06 June 2025,Do you think that being a parent will pay off later in life?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1l4kqc9/do_you_think_that_being_a_parent_will_pay_off/,"Curious to hear your thoughts. Could it be that parenthood is generally something where you pay the price the first 20+ years, but then reap the rewards VS not becoming a parent, reaping the rewards of that the first 20+ years, but then paying the price later in life.

Someone who isn't a parent might have more freedom and autonomy to travel or do other things. But later in life it might feel empty or lonely.

Someone who is a parent might be more constrained, but later in life have a deeper sense of fulfillment and companionship in their older years (after 50).",Unclear: 0 / 0

05 June 2025,Knowingly on the road to ruin,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1l3xht8/knowingly_on_the_road_to_ruin/,"Guys I just have to tell you how much of a loser as a father I (37m) am. We have a 10 month old baby, my wife really wanted it, I went along. Now she constantly tells me what I do wrong, and that‘s only everything. She is a control freak and whatever I do, it isn’t enough for her. Other husbands care more about their families, like to spend more time with them, are more loving, are knowledgeable in terms of what the baby wants, needs, eats, cannot eat, what it goes through in its development etc. I don‘t care at all - according to her. 

Of course, I see it a little differently. I have to admit that I am not a candidate for the father of the year award, mainly because I work 60 hours a week and am regularly depressed because I miss my old life where I had the unfathomable freedom of hiking or cycling in the woods for a few hours or go the gym twice a week. Now, whenever I want to have an hour for a bit of free time, my wife lectures me on how much she has it worse, how bad she feels, how bad she sleeps and how she is the one who really needs a break while I am constantly whining despite sitting in a comfortable office chair all day. She stays at home with our son at the moment and is a full time mom. 

I really don’t know how much longer I can take this. A lot of times before we had our son, my wife was already struggling to cope with just daily life. She constantly complained that she didn’t feel well, that she needed more sleep etc., but back then she couldn’t point the finger at me and blamed it on her job and other circumstances. 

In hindsight I knew that a baby would make matters so much worse. The crazy part is that most of the time in life we are running into ruin with open eyes. Deep down I knew that I shouldn’t, but I did it anyway, not trusting my guts. Now I feel stuck and phantasize about leaving them. However, I love the little fella, and don’t want him out of my life for good - which would almost certainly be the case if I left (my wife already told me).  So I go on. 

I initially wrote that post in a good, almost exhilarated mood, because my wife and our son just drove off to her parents to spend the weekend there. I now have 4 days of my own and I have not felt this happy in a very long time. That‘s all. I wish you all the best. Kind regards from Germany ✌️",Likely father: 8 > 1
05 June 2025,"It's been over a year, it feels that it got bearable, but I don't know if it's just that I got used to living this hell or is it really getting better (probably the first one)",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1l3lic7/its_been_over_a_year_it_feels_that_it_got/,"Warning, long post ahead, this is more like a diary than a post, really.

I'm a 30M father of twin boys.

Whenever I have some need to vent (usually when I can't sleep because of them), I come to reddit warn people about this horrible deal people usually passive-aggressively demands: having kids.

I'll let the 'long story to now' afterwards for people who wants a 'pov' on the father side of experience.

Now, for the reflection on my losses:  
It has been over a year, they both need special formulas, cheap diapers simply don't hold anything and guess which kind of wipe don't give them allergies? Yep. I needed 2 jobs.

While one boy is a heavy sleeper, the other one make our nights almost sleepless, and during the day, they both are hellish, with the plus of the heavy sleeper being a freaking piercing screamer that demands things almost all the time.

For several months we suspected a lot of things, the last suspicion was that because he is a hell of a picky eater he demands calories at night. Unfortunately these last weeks showed us that isn't the case. Back to square one.

Just for the record, yes, we have appointments with pediatricians, but since their birth I felt like doctors just don't give a F you know? We went to a lot of doctors, cheap and expensive, and, while some of them fooled us into thinking they actually care, most are just pathetic (like GPT 3.0 is more accurate and helpful). So we are trying to find the solution ourselves.

Most of nights he awakes 5+ times, some nights we can sleep in 2 parts and we celebrate those, but usually it's 5+ awakenings. Now even the other one wakes screaming sometimes. Lucky us.

You know, I had a 'super hearing' before them, so much that I could hear people whispering behind doors, but I endured so much screaming, day and night, that now I need people to repeat themselves louder.

Not only that, I used to be organized, specially with body and finances, disciplined and overall, decent, proud of myself. Now I'm a complete mess:  
\- My office is so messy that I barely can walk in there.  
\- It has been months since I looked myself properly in the mirror;  
\- Showering and brushing my teeth are things that I only remember to do when I'm 'rotten';  
\- While I still have some strength to lift my 35kg dog to my arms, I can barely make 3 chin/pull ups (I used to make 3 sets of 12, 1min pause, while wearing 10kg weight)...  
\- Whenever I remember I need to eat, I have no energy or will to clean the kitchen so I can cook properly... from January till now I already spent A THOUSAND just on food delivery;  
\- I'm the one cleaning because I know she dealt with those devils, but I only gather myself enough to do it at night, and even that, it's a hard struggle to not just leave as it is. Usually I can clean everything (most are just the dishes anyway), but sometimes I lose the battle halfway through...  
\- Sometimes I wonder how I'm not obese yet;  
\- Most of my days I'm just working on the early morning and then I just 'come back to myself' at late night, then I'm just procrastinating and doom scrolling, completing mandatory tasks (like job or related) it's a struggle that I barely win.  
\- I tried changing phones for weaker ones, so social medias are sluggish, but I'm very clever to find things to procrastinate...  
\- Few days I tried waking up earlier so I can feel the sun on my skin, touch some nature, but it didn't feel worth enough...  
\- Oddly enough, when I go an entire night gaming, even if in the morning I criticize myself for wasting potential rest, most of the next day I feel better, sometimes I do that days in a row, but strangely, I get irritated much easier;

And so on... 

For a long time I used to get frustrated and angry whenever I thought about on how much I lost, I'm losing and will lose because of them, and resented my wife for dragging me into this hell. I still do, but it's so much less than before that it's meaningless.

We still don't sleep, they still pierce my eardrums and do that for a huge chunk of day and night, but, surprisingly, that doesn't trigger me so much anymore.

The mother loves them (emotional masochist probably?), but each day that passes by it's visible how tired she is, she's often losing her patience. Before them if I saw she losing her patience 10 times in 10 years is too much, and I'm not even exaggerating, really. Then, after one year with them, she loses it every other day. And note: SHE LOVES THEM with all her heart!

Because of 2 jobs, our tasks division got split like 70-30 for her, I basically try doing the chores and errands while she deals with those little devils. I can help whenever I can so she can at least shower, nap and being a human being a little while, but I feel like I barely make any difference, it doesn't make me feel bad about myself, but I kinda feel sad for her.

Some days I can get a new thing done, but I feel like each day feels harder, like I need extra will to do anything.

People already advised that I need to build habits, but how can anyone build habits with two little devils screwing up any chance of that?

Basically, I'm 'balanced', I don't feel the same rage anymore, on the other hand, I don't feel the same joy either. I still feel all emotions, but the intensity of anything is just so weak, like whenever I feel a glimpse of sadness, fear, melancholy or the 'righteous fury' (that feeling when you listen to Manowar - Die With Honor), it's like greeting a very old close friend, a very old and decayed friend. 

In some weeks I will read this again and remember how I felt the torment diminishing, but at the same time, wonder if that's just depression numbing my feelings. Maybe I need to change those meds.

So that folks is a detailed 'pov' on being an average father. Don't have kids unless they are your AND your partner life dream.

Long story to now:  
\- Happy about myself overall, decent body, face, money, life. I was in the 'no kids train';

\- Found a great gal, she was so incredible I made her my wife;

\- Her life dream was to be a mother. She convinced me that it would be just a mild inconvenience for me because she was an expert in the subject. She even said she knew EXACTLY what to do to make us rich with them;

\- Though with myself: great deal, I definitely accept bearing a mild inconvenience for the rest of my life to fulfill her life dream. The rich part was just a bonus, really;

\- Then the bad omens: odd pregnancy symptoms, risky pregnancy, unexpected twins, twins with mild health issues in belly, premature delivery, so many complications in every little thing during labor (I think I didn't freak out because I was too tired to think about it, because when I remember everything she went through... holy molly), just for context she emptied like 7 epidural sacks and was still in early labor;

\- I never held a baby before in my entire life, had to overcome the fear of breaking them in a matter of minutes;

\- Every issue known to new mother was happening to her, that was breaking my heart every day;

\- We stayed at the hospital, slept 2 hours a day if much during 2 and a half weeks, piercing double crying every hour or less, that made me angry as hell, but I just shoved deep down the best I could;

\- Wife with visible PPD because labor problems impacted milk production, plus, they were lazy as hell;

\- After a while, we finally decided to go home, nightmareS just began;

\- Stomach problems on both, severe skin problem on one, relatives trying to impose shitty things onto us and the little devils (e.g.: 'hold them until they sleep', sure, then when they never want to sleep in the crib, guess who will hold them for a long period?);

\- Their health issues created my money issues, we went for charity;

\- I was awake 20 hours a day solving so many documentations, appointments, fetching supplies, doing researches (pediatricians were not interested in doing their job, so I was the one to find the mix of medicines to cure my boy severe dermatitis after studying hard);

\- Lot of couple issues. In my perspective:  
a) wife couldn't help me fetch supplies, but she definitely could go to pool parties and pleasant activities;  
b) wife struggling hard to do what she was meant to be the expert, and I was doing excellent, that kinda enraged me (I was the one supposed to be struggling dealing with kids, not you! Where are those so many years of experience you bragged about?);  
c) I had to fight off every relative crazy ideas of raising babies, mostly without any support or backup from her;  
d) I felt like I was the father, mother, counselor, medic and everything between, in my perspective, I just didn't see her trying remotely close of what I was doing;

\- Months went by, I bottled up my feelings trying to spare her because of her's PPD, but I knew I couldn't go on much longer;

\- Went to therapy for the first time in life, therapist said she was impressed that I didn't unalive myself with so many things from past and present summed up. I said: hey, my insurance would not cover it, not at least I have 2 years paying it. I laugh, she was very worried.

\- Some fights with wife because of tiredness, laundry, dirty, messes, who should do what, you know, the usual, all with the 'screamo' as background noise. The so called parenting is without any doubt the most enjoyable way of living.",Likely father: 5 > 3

Don’t get me wrong here, I absolutely DON’T think in-laws should be responsible for babysitting my children. It’s just by saying things like that could really cloud the decision of whether to have children or not for the couple. It creates both pressure and false hopes.

Sometimes you're going to find yourself in a hopeless situation and everyone will say ""get therapy"" and you've done that and everything else. So then what? Has anyone else noticed that therapy is more popular than ever but then so is suicide? I think the false promise that you can fix all your problems just makes people more hopeless in the long run. There's no such thing as perfect parenting and there are some problems that you can't ""fix"" that's why I try to be a listening ear and share my struggles to support others and I hope they can do the same for me without just telling me to shell out all my disposable income on some fake fix.",Unclear: 0 / 0

03 June 2025,UPDATE: we checked our daughter into a residential program today,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1l1zgk6/update_we_checked_our_daughter_into_a_residential/,"This is the safest and most at peace I have felt in a long time. She’ll be there for at least 60 days. She can work on what she needs to work on, and we can try to start recovering. 

For at least 60 days, we don’t need to worry about whether or not the knives are locked up. We know that we’re coming home to calm. I can just enjoy my wife’s company. We can go do something by ourselves if we want to. 

If my daughter starts dissociating, or switching personalities, hallucinating, or goes back into psychosis, she is a place where professionals handle it. Not us. They will now be providing 24/7 supervision. Not us. They can worry about if the medications are working. They can monitor who she talks to. They can worry about whether or not she’s lying. Not us. Finally. Not. Us. 

She is in the safest place that she can possibly be right now, for all of our sakes. And the biggest weight has been lifted. 

I don’t know what happens next. It’s 100% on her now. She does the right thing or she doesn’t. When it comes down to it, she will be the one to suffer any negative consequences. I won’t be the one who is homeless, hooked on drugs, or in prison. She will be. And I can’t save her from it.  

We have done everything we can. We can’t keep setting ourselves on fire to keep her warm. 

I still wish that we could go back in time and make a different choice. I can’t imagine ever getting to a point of acceptance. We are traumatized. This has destroyed me. It’s too late to have the family we had dreamed of.

02 June 2025,I hate my life so much since becoming a mother,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1l1kw1z/i_hate_my_life_so_much_since_becoming_a_mother/,"I have a 5 year old autistic non-verbal daughter, and a 3 year old son. Both are done with school since last week. Since I'm a freelance Digital Marketing Manager I mostly work from home, and Mondays were actually a thing I'd look forward to. For a couple of hours I would *finally* get a quiet and tiddy home, and I could work and/or run errands in peace from 7:30am til they came home at 3PM.

Their dad (who I been married to for 11 years) and I separated about a month ago, so since he doesn't live at the house anymore the mayority of the time its just me stuck at home with both kids since I can't really do much with my oldest being autistic. He works as a manager in a men's department store, so the days he would come home at around 6PM, we would tend to the kids together and divide and conquer bedtime. Now it's mostly me the days he doesn't come over and/or takes the kids.

This past weekend I had the kids, so I'm exhausted, overstimulated and overwhelmed af. And since school is over, instead of a relaxing Monday morning were I can drink my coffee in peace and work in silence, I have two kids ALL DAY at home making noises, fighting, asking me for shit, and making messes while I'm *trying to work.* My youngest doesn't start summer camp until Wednesday, and my oldest is staying home with me all summer since the government defunded Special Education programs where I'm from. I also can't afford a nanny or a helper in my current financial state.

I truly hate my life, I hate that I'm the only one that has to bend to everyone's schedule so I can have alone time, leave the house, or do anything really. Before they started school, I was a work-from-home-mom and I'd be home with BOTH kids *EVERY DAY ALL DAY* just waiting for the moment their dad finally came home from work so I could be left alone and lock myself in my room.

STBX works every day except Wednesdays, and a couple of Sundays a month. The rest of the week AND weekends he works either from 8am to 5pm, or from noon to 9pm. If he worked on a Sunday, he's out from 10am to 7pm. His job is one of the many reason I asked for a divorce. I'm also the default parent, main provider (Yes, I also make more money), and of course, the one the runs the mental load, schedules, appointments, etc. My mom is the only family member that helps out with them, but she still works also. But at least she cares for them or takes them for the weekend whenever she can.

For the past almost 6 years, I've been super depressed while constantly sacrificing my physical and mental health. I get constant migraines, I'm almost always in a irritable mood, I'm so anxious I barely eat. Most days I feel sick or very fatigued that I can barely function, I'm always behind in work because I'm juggling 20 things at the same time with my kids and don't have a team to delegate things to, my cortisol levels are always high, my needs always come last, I barely leave this effing house and most days I just don't want to go on.

I have obsessive thoughts like ""Why the \*\*\*\* did I have kids?"" or ""Why did I want a family?"" since everything in my life sucks so much since then. I truly *hate* motherhood in every way, I hate that my STBX just gets to do whatever without having to find childcare or help, while I have to keep mothering, thinking about everything and everyone's needs while also keep running the show *no matter what*.

I've been up since 6:30am with both kids. I wrote this rant at 9:35AM while locked up in my bathroom sobbing from the sadness and desperation I feel. The day already feels like a lifetime, and summer is just barely beggining.

And yes, I go to therapy once a week. It helps, but doesn't change how things function for me at home. I don't know how I'm going to survive this summer, or continue on with this life. I just have to hope better times are coming...",Likely mother: 2 > 1

Can’t even grocery shop correctly without ticking him off by turning away, moving just a tiny bit from the cart, taking whatever he reached off the shelves  to put it back. Can’t even listen to music in the car before he screams about the music starting AND ending. Just screams screams screams. 

Recently took him to an indoor pool and when he screamed, it sounded like a *very* high pitched sound alarm. Maybe worse idk but of course everyone turned my way. He went on a play date with three other kids and as soon as he screamed, they never came back to play with him. And they’re also toddlers… the parents are looking at me weird and lessen their interactions with me every time he does something. He snatches passies, sippy cups, toys out of their hand. He accidentally dragged one of them down when he was just trying to give them a hug. He’s all smiles while the other kids are terrified. My heart drops every time I think about it. 

I have to apologize to every single person I’ve talked on the phone to excuse his screaming. I have to blow in his face to make it stop for 0.1 seconds. I can’t go nowhere to excuse myself before he’s right behind me haunting me with that damn cry of his. Just make it stop I want it stop so bad. I don’t want to lose my hearing, I want to sing. It has always been my escape for everything. Can’t take care of my mental health without his screaming and constant attention seeking messing it up. I just want it stop.",Unclear: 0 / 0

You can put up with a lot during the week--at work (I work a traditional M-F 8-5) at home wherever whatever--when you know that for at least 2 days and 2 nights you will have some freedom to just be you. Decompress, celebrate, drive to that new place or old place, seeing friends: all these things are vital to life. But just as vital is knowing those things are out there for you soon, part of your present feelings and perception of your own life. When you don't have that, it's just a slog every single day. 

I wake up on Saturday and it's just another day. It may as well be Monday. Sometimes I even look forward to Monday on Friday.

Unfortunately my state does not allow the choice of termination. So I had thought to go with adoption, but my whole family was against it along with my child’s father‘s family. When I said I was planning on adopting out my mother ended up telling my entire entire family that I got pregnant and everybody was blowing up my phone, telling me how horrible I would be for not keeping my child. And that they would help. My mom even threatened to take me to court over it. I was young & pregnant at the time and very hormonal. The time comes for me to give birth and deliver my baby. I call the adoption agency. And as I did, my partner’s mom came in and was begging me to keep my child. Long story short I nearly died giving birth. I keep my kid my partner’s mom offers me a place to stay and says she would help with the baby. Fast forward to not even a week later she tells me that she doesn’t like the fact that the baby cries and makes a lot of noise and then I have to find somewhere else to go. My son was literally a week old at the time. I was very upset because I knew what I wanted, but I felt horrible, putting my son up for adoption because of everything that everybody told me throughout my entire pregnancy. I knew I wasn’t ready for the mental toll that was going to be taken upon me, but I just kept thinking about everything that everyone else wanted. I called my mom to help me and she said I didn’t make the baby why should I help. I just think back to how she kept begging me because she wanted to be a grandma so bad.

Almost a decade.. since her being diagnosed with autoimmune disease when she was 5 years old to the the present now. I really wonder if I’m living in this psychological hell. I’ve run out of ways to cope including the unhealthy ways. Even when I try drinking the emptiness overcomes me and all I want to do is just go to sleep and never wake up. It’s like I’m immune to alcohol now. I find myself shutting down several times a day. Where I just want to be in my head and not even talk to my kids. Hearing them and seeing their presence puts my depressive state to a severe level. I feel like I’m self destructing  but the worst part is I’m bringing them down with me. I am that mother that moms hate. And I can’t change it. It’s almost like it’s my nature. I know now that I was never meant to want kids. I can’t adapt to motherhood.. I told my husband this and he told me why don’t I just leave and that he’ll take over and raise them but under the condition that I never come back. The crazy thing is that I know I’m a piece of shit of a mother and the only time that mother instincts hit me is when confronted with abandoning them. I just can’t.. I know I’m selfish for this. But abandoning them would not give me peace of mind or reverse anything. In fact if I did leave I would never stop wondering if they are ok or if they are suffering..

My son ia 7 months old, me and the mom recently split, it was a toxic environment and the relationship was fairly new and our son was unplanned, receipe for disaster we gave it a go but ultimately we are incompatible so coparenting now 50/50 split.

Now i struggled with fatherhood be it unplanned and be it that it was with a gf at the time who i didnt see a real future with. I did everything i was supposed to do though, provided financially, night feeds, nappy changes worked full time while she was on maternity leave.

I was in for a huge shock when my son was born, i didnt realise how selfish i actually was. I didnt realise how much time/freedom you give up having a child and i really struggled adjusting as i said ofc i did everything a dad should do but i never felt any joy from it more obligation.

Ive realised fatherhood isnt for everyone, in my case im not made to be a dad im too selfish. Do you dads who are lets say married and parent full time find it rewarding. Like id catch myself reading my son a book or watching a cartoon and zoning out and not being in the moment. 

Im getting so theraphy now, because i do think im suffering from post natal depression i done a screening and it checked out. Perhaps when i get out of this ill enjoy it more. However i do feel depressed or not, sacraficing my entire life to raise a child isnt worth the sacrafice. Now im coparenting i have a taste of both worlds which provides balance, i have no desire to have any more children or get married as i dont feel like the family life is for me perhaps its my depression but i genuinely feel this way.

I speak to my frienda who have kids and their weeks are spent going to kid bdays/kid holidays/school discos etc like i honestly dont think id enjoy that lifestyle. Now i know ill be doing it 50% of the time as a coparent and i think i may enjoy it then as its 50% of the time but i feel if it were 100% of the time and 24/7 i wouldnt cope.

School has only been out for 4 days. Today is my first day working from home with my 16 yr old in the house since school let out. We just had a huge blow out argument. All because she refuses to eat what’s in the house. 

She wants fast food every single day. I have thrown so much money away on her fast food habit and I’m done. She has gone through great lengths to get it. Weeks ago I found out that she had been Door Dashing using her grandmother’s debit card when she runs out of her allowance. So she lost the right to Door Dash and has to pay her grandma back. 

I have also put my foot down by refusing to get her fast food for the rest of the week. She was told yesterday how it would be. I just paid $400 for her summer school courses, another $200 for a money mgmt camp and over $1000 on car repairs. All this in one week! I am broke and not spending the little I have left eating out. Also, she needs to learn how to eat what is in the house. All that fast food is not good for her and it’s unrealistic to think you can eat out every day of the week. 

She wasn’t trying to hear that. She started yelling, bucking up to me, telling me to shut up, and cursing at me. And I gave it right back to her. No, it wasn’t the way to handle it but I am F’n tired! I do so much for this child. I go above and beyond in every way. I’m tired of being disrespected and talked to crazy. I’m tired of her walking up on me like she wants to fight. Had I done that to my parents, I would not be here today. I absolutely hate parenting. If I had known that this is what parenting would looked like for me, I would’ve never had a child. 

I cannot go through the whole summer dealing with a kid who explodes everytime things don’t go her way. The last thing I want is to go in the office on the 2 days I work from home. But I can’t spend my days arguing and having WW3 over petty stuff when I’m supposed to be working.

Let me start by saying I had horrendous pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy (to the point of being a disability for 4.5 months) so I have been unable to do any exercise or physical care for a while already, to say nothing of the general damage pregnancy does to your body. I feel broken and completely unlike me physically but too knackered to do anything about it, and it looks like my pelvic pain is coming back and there's a risk it's now permanent. So that's great, and how much the physical burden of pregnancy is drastically underplayed is an entirely different post.

I love my son and reading other posts on here I have nothing to complain about in terms of his feeding, sleeping etc. I adore my baby's father and he is a very active and involved parent. We are lucky enough to not have any financial worries with welcoming a baby, who was planned.

On paper I have nothing whatsoever to complain about, but I am still finding this really hard. It is not really anything like I thought it would be and I feel completed lied to and gaslit by everyone I know with children and society at large. I can see how parents (moms especially) are completely consumed by parenting and cease to exist as the person they were before children. I thought I knew what I was signing up for, but actually living it and having no time for me or my husband, no sleep and not really living any more has been rough.

I really miss my old life and I had so much time that I wasted, so many things that I could have done but didn't because I thought I was 'tired' or 'too busy' and now I'm mourning all those things. I suppose I'm looking for reassurance that it can and does get better, or at least you can get back to some semblance of your life before even though it will obviously look different in a lot of ways.

26 May 2025,I totally resent parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kvw1t5/i_totally_resent_parenting/,"Ever since my child has been born, it has been such an awful experience. It's been a waste of money, time and effort and I haven't felt happy or fulfilled with parenting at all. I have tried therapy and talking with friends and honestly nothing changes the fact that I just loathe parenting. Fortunately my child is 10 years old so I have 8 more years but it feels like a complete prison sentence

I have full custody of the child and his mother is invovled but she is mostly useless and sucks at making money and making decisions. So, I am leaned on heavily for everything. I pay his health insurance, which is outrageously high, all his clothes and everything. She just does what she can and spends time with him, basically she is a loser 

I had the child when I was 20. So grateful because I will have my life back at 38. Things are so bad that I live with close family to make it all work and we all love a comfortable life but the sacrifices for me just aren't worth it at all. The must joy I experience with the child is that thank goodness they are getting older

It's basicially and unreciprocal sacrfice all the time with no reward or good thing coming out of it for me. It's just not worth it and I have been told that most fathers that say this just walk away from parenting and I totally don't blame them. I'm trapped in an area I don't want to be in, around people that I don't care for but we support each other to make it work, working a job that I don't care for but pays a lot so I can support the child and making unreciprocal and awful sacrifices all the time with no internally or external reward for myself 

I learned that I will never be in this type of situation again. Once the child is 18 and my obligation is over, I will make sure to never be in this situation again. I will walk away from everyone around me, block my ex and do what I want all the time. I will never sacrifice like this again and will never care for a child again. It's been such an awful experience

We had my husband’s family over and everyone basically ambushed me accusing me of not feeding my son enough and that I need to feed him more. My son refuses to eat most food he has about a handful of foods that he eats. He is on the thin side yes both my husband and I are short (I’m 5’2 110 lbs) my son is about 53 lbs. my husband didn’t even have my back or anything. He was agreeing that I don’t feed him enough. I try to give him different foods he just won’t eat them. I wish I never had him because he is only bringing me stress. You know how badly I feel being accused of starving my son. He’s been thin his whole life even as a baby I really think that’s just how he is going to be.

I get over stimulated by noise quickly! My son is at that age (4mo) and has made the realization that his vocal chords can do more than just crying. He will stay awake for hours (4-5+) just babbling, cooing, squealing, etc. and it's SO ANNOYING. Friends and family find it ""cute"" and ""awwwww he found his voice!!!"" It's not cute! It's irritating. It's overstimulating.

My husband will want to spend time together but I don't want to be anywhere near him because I can't stand the constant noise. It's like nails on a chalkboard to me. Obviously he's learning and making connections and he needs to be making these noises, I understand that... But man is it just annoying. You can't of course rant about it to anyone because all anyone else sees is just how cute it is because they aren't around it 24/7. I also think these larger milestones are what is potentially preventing him from sleeping... He's learning to self entertain and is keeping himself up for hours and hours... He doesn't sleep....

24 May 2025,"At the bare minimum, I thought they at least love you",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kubu6e/at_the_bare_minimum_i_thought_they_at_least_love/,"I am a STAHM to a freshly two year old. I became a one and done mom within three weeks after birth because I felt I was instantly sold a lie and wouldn't trap myself further.

My child was VERY wanted and I was so grateful we conceived with no issue. I did all the things a mom is supposed to while pregnant. I sung to her, rubbed and poked at my belly, talked to her constantly, I hated being pregnant but tried to gaslight myself into feeling the ""love"" I should because I knew the hormones would help her. I did it all ""right""

Then she came. From the get, she didn't like being held by me. At first I played it off saying ""oh, she's just so grateful to be out!"" But it hurt like hell. She rejected my breastmilk no matter what I did or tried. She would absolutely NOT do contact naps. When she was in pain (gas) she would scream louder when I held her and tried to soothe her. When she got more mobile she adamantly rejected comfort when she'd injure herself. I thought maybe autism but she had no problem with grandma (who was hardly around for the pregnancy or the newborn stage).  Now she seeks comfort for pain but she had to be taught to do it. But Mama kisses do NOT make it better 

I went through extreme ppd/ppr/ppa but hid it very well from everyone but my husband who got me help at month 13. I never let it get to me while I was taking care of her. I always was a trooper through the pain and faked the loving happy mom for her. There's tons of candid photos from my husband where I look like the glowing happy new mom and am ALWAYS smiling at her. Which was really hard considering how much I felt she didn't like me. 

It took so long to get her to speak or use asl of any kind. I didn't even get ""mama"" until month 16 and it's still rare. She's two and has to be prompted to say ""I love you"" still. She's very demanding, is constantly getting into anything she can, has had meltdowns within 5 seconds since birth, is a biter/clawer/pincher/hitter when she gets mad, and is overall keeps getting brattier and brattier. We don't do ipads and she gets an hour of screen time a day (was recommended for her speech). Ms. Rachel receives more excitement than the slave she has in me. 

I used to be THE cook and everyone loved my baking. She's rejected anything that doesn't come from a box since the moment I introduced food. If I made it, it'll end up on the walls, floor, ceiling, or myself. 

I wanted to be a gentle mom. I wanted to be the patient mom who talks everything out. The only way she listens is if I am VERY firm. Not yelling but a stone hard voice. I have never been a permissive parent and hold boundaries firmly. I choose my battles wisely and still feel absolutely defeated by the end of the day. If I even got one ""Mama!"" And a smile I think I'd be better. But I get no sweetness back in return. Those moments people talk about making it worth it just don't really happen. I have to get a hug in by chasing her and making it a fun little game. If I try and hug her without the games she will push away and yell ""no!"" I respect her autonomy so I don't push... but I thought it was just a given that they love you. 

 My mom just wasn't a great mom. Not horrific like some people. But generally just selfish and entitled. She put us through more than we ever should have had to go through. I still loved her. I loved her so much. I gladly stepped over the hot coals she asked me to and never expected the thank you that wouldn't come. Something in me instinctively just loved her so much.

 I'm nothing like my mother. I give so much love so freely and don't expect her to give me anything like I was expected to give in return. I don't expect her to be my babysitter, therapist, or verbal punching bag. I give her space when she doesn't want physical love. I don't have expectations for her life before she's even had the time to choose. I take her as she is and I love her dearly. I just don't understand why she doesn't have a want me at all. 

I didn't have a child to fill a void like my mom. I had a beautiful relationship with my husband and he's an incredible partner and father. She's just as nasty to him so we have solidarity in that. I had her so I could raise a human. Teach her about life. Show her beautiful things. Give her all the love that I should have received. Be proud of her accomplishment and be her cheerleader. See her eyes light up when she experiences things she enjoys. We wanted children so we could see the joy in life from a new set of eyes and give everything he and I lacked growing up. 

I just.... I thought the love was a bonus. I thought that they just inherently loved you. I thought they inherently wanted to make you proud. I realize now that the reason I loved my mom so much and vied for her approval is because I didn't receive it. And that maybe all this is a sign that she's so loved and comfortable with us that she doesn't feel the need to seek it out. Idk anymore. It just breaks my heart.

24 May 2025,"(UPDATE) After 3+ years of fighting, my daughter is finally going inpatient.",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kum91v/update_after_3_years_of_fighting_my_daughter_is/,"Thank you this sub for all of the kindness, and helping me realize I’m not a monster. I haven’t been on in a while, but it sticks with me through this struggle. I especially appreciate the kind Redditors who reached out directly, even a few months. You’re amazing people who made a difference to me. Seriously. 

(TLDR up until now: my wife (44/F) and I (38/F) adopted a teenager (14/F then, now 17/F) out of the system. She received minimal testing and services before she was placed in our home, and the foster care agency told us lie after lie throughout the entire process. Attempts to get her help over the past three years have been met with massive roadblocks.)

Shit has really sucked since my last post. We hit the lowest of the lows. Every “support” we received from the mental health agency make the problems worse, to the point where we pulled her from every service except individual therapy and med management. (The new therapist is great, at least.) 

My daughter weaponized the help that we were trying to get her, and exploited her resources to get what she wanted. Part of her services included respite, which ended up being the worst possible thing that could have happened. She would start making suicidal threats so that she could get screened into respite. She had the people at the emergency mental health center wrapped around her finger… they would just send her. 

And then we found out why through the resource officer *at the middle school.* She was having an inappropriate relationship with a 13 y/o girl who lives at one of the respite homes. (17 & 13 does violate consent laws in our state.) She didn’t end up charged with anything, but she was strongly toeing the line. 

Both schools were made aware. We thought we got through to her the multiple times we told her she needed to stay away from this girl because she was a child, and explained what being a sex offender would mean for the rest of her life. 

After that, we had a couple of relatively good months. She seemed to have her head screwed on straight, but of course we now know that she was just flying under our radar. 

And then got a call from the officer again, saying that they found out the girls were still communicating. Photos were exchanged, again just barely toeing the line of what wouldn’t get my daughter arrested. 

My daughter started threatening suicide in therapy that day, and said she couldn’t be safe to get in the car because she might “lash out” at my wife. She wanted to try to be screened into respite (even though we had told her over and over that would no longer be an option), but instead she was transported by law enforcement to the ER. 

She screened into another short term stay that did nothing but listen to her lie and charm. We legally had to pick her up, like every other time. 

But this time something changed. Her insurance company reached out to us after she was discharged. My wife was honest. They immediately escalated it to a team who would screen her in for a long term stay. We told them we had already tried this and been denied four times. We’ve been sent back with a daughter actively in psychosis, who is a danger to herself and others, on numerous occasions. We told them we would let them try, but that we had zero hope or optimism that it was going to happen.  

Y’all. They made it happen. Normally we would be waitlisted for months, which was time we don’t have anymore. She checks in 9 days from now. We have a date and time set in stone. 

My daughter is actually on board with going. We hope this means she actually wants help. I think she’s scared of turning 18 while she is on this path. 

I guess we’ll see. I still try not to get my hopes up, but we have been able to talk to people about EXACTLY what she needs to be focusing on. She will be around people 24/7, for an amount of time that means she won’t be able to lie and charm. 

The also littlest bit of hope that we got was that she finally received diagnoses during the last hospital stay. DID and bipolar disorder. We have already discussed our concerns about schizophrenia with the intake people. 

Do I still wake up every day wishing we would have made any other choice? Yes. Absolutely. At this rate, I think I could be on my deathbed at age 103 and still have deep regrets. I wish I would have chosen any other child, given birth, or just settled for being a crazy dog/cat/chicken lady for the rest of my life. 

It’s just sad. If I said to somebody that I keep sharp objects locked up because I’m afraid my spouse will kill me, there would be help. But when it’s your child, nobody fucking cares. You cry, you scream, you get angry, you lose hope. You live with a stigma that makes you afraid to open up to people. 

But for a few months, we get to breathe. We don’t have to worry about who we are going to be dealing with on a day-by-day or even hour-by-hour basis. We won’t have to worry about whether all sharp objects are locked up. We can go places if we want to.

I’m 6 months postpartum and I unfortunately have been a single mom since the beginning.

I feel so stupid now and irresponsible for not making the tough choice back then. Now I’m suffering and brought another human into this world to suffer along. 
I know I’m going through depression and it’s only gotten worse with time. Currently living with family is also making it worse. I also know I’m not showing up as a good mom. I just don’t feel like I can give more than what I’m currently giving and have already given up to have my daughter. My mom and sisters have been pointing out how I need to be doing more since the beginning or walk away and leave my daughter with them. 
I just don’t know if this is PPD or if I truly am not cutout to be a mom. I’ve been going to therapy since 3 months postpartum and I still feel the same way. I have been breastfeeding so medication has been off the table, but I’ve gone through depression in the past and although medication numbs the problems, it wasn’t until I got out of certain environments that I didn’t feel depressed anymore.

This is an update to my thread from last year https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/s/jHRnnwMIAP.

First of all, thank you for your incredible support and kind words. I thought I was being irrational by thinking he was and still is abusing me, but you all just helped me see the situation more clearly.

So what happened after that thread? I left my screen unlocked as I had to run to one of the babies. He read the thread and gave me so much shit. He tried to say that I was inventing stuff that he did help me wash the pumps (ONE TIME, BECAUSE I FUCKING ASKED HIM TO - ONE DAMN TIME) and that he was never that abusive. He tried to guilt trip me in any way he could. That was the last drop. I had to hide Reddit for a while so he wouldn’t start controlling my every move.

I live in a foreign country, neither of us has family nearby and my friends are sharing an apartment with other 6 people so I can’t really run anywhere. 

I decided to fake it until I make it. I hired a nanny (I’m working like crazy to make sure I have the money to pay for her since he’s not willing to pay) she’s an angel. While she’s with my sons I’m working on my mental and physical health (I’m trying to lose the pregnancy weight, keep my pcos and metabolic syndrome under control and regain the muscles I lost when I was on bed rest - healthy mum, healthy sons), budgeting and making plans to leave. I’ve started recording EVERYTHING he says to me or the children. I’m collecting every text message I sent to my friends about the abuse, and I’m starting a diary soon. I’ve talked to the nanny about the abuse and she says that she can definitely see it as she was in an abusive relationship for 12 years. She’s on my side and she’s protecting me the best she can. 

All this while keeping a smile on my face so that he doesn’t think I’m planning on leaving. I fear the abuse would just get worse if he found out. 

He tried to get physical three times: 

1. He was rocking one baby to sleep and he was getting more and more frustrated. I stepped in, with kindness, and said “can I take the baby?” He shoved me against the wall and said “out of my way” - I was shocked and I tried to justify him. I shouldn’t have.

2. One baby was having troubles eating at some point as he had bad reflux, he was trying to force him to drink milk and I told him “if he doesn’t want to eat, leave him alone. He will eat later” he started screaming like a damn animal and I said “please, stop screaming and give me the baby. I’ll handle it” he literally threw the baby at me and I said “careful, you’ll hurt him” he raised one hand as if he wanted to slap me. I froze, and I don’t know with what strength I told him “the actual f are you trying to do?” He ran into the living room.

3. Shortly after that, I decided to rock the baby to sleep but I had my headphones in the living room. Naively, I tried to open the door to get them, he slammed it in my face. I said “look, I need to grab something from the living room” I tried to open the door again, he opened it on the other side and raised his fist at my face. I lost it and said “look, I’m not afraid of hitting back. I know where this is going, I grew up with an abusive father. You do not scare me. Back off.”

He never tried to get physical again after that, but probably it’s just because he understood that I wouldn’t make it easy for him. When I confronted him about it he said that I imagined everything (ofc lmao).

I’m scared. What if I don’t make it? I don’t want to be like my mum. My sons deserve a safe place. They deserve happiness. I know what it feels like to grow up in an abusive household. I know what it feels like to recognise the mood of your father just by the sound of his footsteps. I lived in fear, I don’t want them to endure the same shit I had to endure.

22 May 2025,Vent post,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ksg3z1/vent_post/,"I’m 28 and my son is 6. I parent him alone, my own choice because his dad couldn’t show any responsibility and he just stopped contacting us long ago knowing he couldn’t be a responsible parent. I had low expectations that he couldnt even meet. I have no parents. My dad died 5 years ago and my mom has always been an irresponsible parent. We don’t even talk. 

My son gave me the will to step up and do better, be better than my own parents. He’s helped me become a great person and I’m grateful for that. I’m a first generation college student and support us both, doing college and working by myself . It’s been such a struggle but our lives keep becoming better. We’ve built a great support system despite not having family. 

Despite that, I feel like it keeps becoming harder. My son was such a chill baby. Hardly ever cried or got into things , was always calm. Till he hit about 5. Now at 6, he never stops talking, asking me dumb questions, making weird overstimulating sound effects, jumping around, talking to me about Pokémon and other stuff I don’t care about. Ordering me around and telling me how to respond to him. Ordering me to respond to him. Asking me if I like this dinosaur, what my favorite sonic character is, when I don’t care about any of that. Telling me what he wants for dinner, what movie he wants, what song he wants me to play in the car. Saying be wishes we could do this or that. And I don’t give in to demands or requests quite frankly, he always keeps them coming though. He usually asks nicely but I still can’t stand it. I feel like I’m always demanded of something. Always under a microscope. Every little thing I do is critiqued or questioned. I try to remain neutral and not show annoyance or frustration because he’s just a kid and he’s a good kid but he’s so damn annoying. 

Every person who meets him tells me he’s the best kid and I feel terrible. I know he’s a great kid. I love him to death and I let him know that but I just want left alone most of the time. I’m so tired of constantly being screamed at by a tiny voice about Dino’s and Pokémon and being ordered around. He’s made my life so much better but I also feel imprisoned to parenthood as in I can’t get a moment of peace and I can never truly escape. 

Even when I put on noise canceling headphones he still follows me around and tells me things even though I told him I can’t hear him. I try to be loving and validating but it’s so exhausting because I want left alone and I just want to be able to go do things when I want. I never wanted to be a parent. I would never want to give him up but I just want more freedom and peace. 

To make matters worse, I have my first boyfriend since having my son and we’ve been together for a year. Hes the most responsible, hard working man I’ve ever met. He doesn’t have a child but he’s so great with my son, being caring towards him and planning things we can do together. My boyfriend is slightly on the spectrum and tells me that he’s worried about us all having a future like living together and he told me recently that he wishes I didn’t have a kid. It hurt so bad. I don’t think he meant it as bad as it sounds because I know he cares for my son despite saying that. Even if it’s not a deal breaker and I think my boyfriend just gets in his head about connecting with my son like what that looks like and it’s confusing , but I know it’s true deep down. 

Sometimes I wish I didn’t have a kid but I’d never give him up. My son has made me a better person, but has made my life so much harder in ways. I’ve just really been feeling the woes lately. 

I do my best to give us a good life and keep good people in our life but he makes everything difficult and overstimulating even if he’s a good kid. I chose to keep him and I love him but I can’t believe this is my life sometimes. Single parent with no family support, full time worker and college student. I don’t feel like I deserve this but I know I did it to myself. I just wish I at least had helpful parents or that his father was trustworthy to take him on the weekends but I have to do everything. I drink almost every night to take the edge off of everything on my shoulders. I don’t go overboard, I work hard every day and manage all A’s in college but I wish I didn’t have to do that, that it was all easier, and that I was a happier mom. I’m lucky to have a great child but I can’t even enjoy it from all the responsibilities on my shoulders",Likely mother: 5 > 1

We can't afford daycare. I'm home with baby. Husband taking care of things financially. I've always done fine on my own or with my own money.

It’s just insanely true. They want at least 2 children and they just put their 2 minutes in you, sit back and relax during and after pregnancy and let the wife do everything. No wonder men always want so many kids because they aren’t expected to do anything. 

My husband said it wouldn’t be terrible if I got pregnant and I was freaking out even the idea of getting pregnant again. He said he doesn’t need another child but it just wouldn’t be the end of the world for him. But I told him it would be for me. 

I’m not paying a $20k hospital bill, they always bill the mother and I’m not paying that. We got lucky with our child where the entire hospital bill was covered because we had good insurance at the time. 

I’m not going through pregnancy again. It took two years to get back to my pre pregnancy weight and I’m still fat and I’m still trying to lose weight since this mommy pooch won’t go away

I’ve been pressured by my ex coworkers from my last job to have another baby even though I said I’m not going to have another one and they act shocked like why?! I say I just don’t want to do it all over again. They tell me that I need a sibling for my baby and it’s basically selfish and I’ll get through it.

And now our child is making my life a living hell. She is extremely difficult about everything, constantly fighting , and crying and acting up when you try to do anything, such as change her diaper, do her hair, or wipe her face off.

14 May 2025,I regret becoming a parent,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1km0com/i_regret_becoming_a_parent/,"I’m 32, my daughter is about to turn 3. I love her, but I absolutely hate being a parent. I’m a naturally introverted and distant person who needs a lot of space and alone time. That’s next to impossible to get with a toddler. I also hate loud noises, messes, and being needed by someone 24/7. I am miserable, depressed and mentally running on fumes.
I find myself constantly mourning my old life. I’m so envious of my childfree friends. I don’t really have any mom friends because I can’t seem to connect with other mothers. All they ever want to talk about is their kids. No thank you. 

My husband and I are separated but still cohabitating due to financial reasons. (We didn’t work out as a couple but we get along otherwise. We seem to make better friends, tbh. But I do think having a child put a huge strain on our marriage and is one of the reasons we separated.) 
We split parenting duties as much as we can, but I find myself still dreading my time with her and counting down until bedtime/naptime/her time with dad. 
My parents also usually get her every other weekend and it is truly the best couple days of my life. It’s my saving grace.

She really is a wonderful child, she’s smart, funny, kind, and creative. She deserves better than me. I don’t resent her, I just hate what parenting involves. Everything has to revolve around her. I genuinely think I’m just too selfish to have kids and I realized this too late. It was fine when she was an infant, in fact I actually enjoyed that stage. She just wanted to cuddle and sleep with me all day long. Toddlers are feral and exhausting. 

I am one and done, but it doesn’t stop my current struggle with my child. 
She starts preschool this fall, so that will at least give me a bit more of a break. I’m counting down to September.

I wish I was in a position to hire a full time nanny or caregiver like a lot of wealthy people do, but I’m not in that tax bracket. 

I want to give her the best childhood possible but I really don’t think I am cut out for this.",Unclear: 2 / 2

Their dad - my husband - left for the 3rd or 4th time so now a single parent. I don’t get any help. No village. No breaks. I’m very depressed because I am an angry mom. I think all the time that I shouldn’t have had kids because these kids deserve someone who can parent them with patience. I deal with so much inside my head. I didn’t have a mom, she was an addict and died when I was 10. My dad was and still is emotionally unavailable. I was primarily raised by my older sister who is 11 years older than me, she was verbally abusive and mean to me.  I have much more trauma that I can’t unpack on this past. However I’m coming to learn now that the reason I am the way I am is because I have always pretended nothing bad ever happened to me. I have always blocked it all out. Now that I have kids and they’re growing up I become triggered at so many things and I don’t know why. I’m always yelling at my kids. I’m always angry. I’m always depressed. My kids are very hard to deal with. My seven-year-old I think has ADHD. He is impossible to please. He consistently asked for things that has repetitive and doesn’t respect boundaries to the point where I have to blow up even if I remove my self, he follows me to keep asking me the same things. I feel like I have failed him. I feel like the way he is because of who I was as a parent when he was little. I didn’t really bond with him until he was around a year. I was 20 when I had him and my relationship with his dad has always been so rocky. I basically have been unsupported as a parent for years. My four-year-old daughter will yell at me in public if she doesn’t get her way and she’s constantly doing I think she’s not supposed to and immediately when I pick her up from preschool she’s complaining about something or asking for something and will cry or get mad at me and it instantly ruins my mood. My three-year-old can be very sweet, but he’s sweet but very aggressive and he yells a lot and will tell me no and do it anyways. He also doesn’t take no for an answer. I recently took away all three kids iPads a week ago and hopes that this would change their behavior. I haven’t really noticed a big change. Just hoping that it comes because I’m at my wits end.

Taking it back to my childhood I didn’t have really any bears that took care of me growing up so I don’t know what it looks like to be a good parent. I have no recollection of anybody being caring or really loving to be growing up. I don’t like affection and my kids are very affectionate. I don’t feel like I should have not become a parent but now I have these kids and I have them alone and it feels deafening. My soon to be ex-husband claims he left because I am so unhappy and angry all the time with him and the kids. I’m the primary and the default parent so I feel like my anger is getting confused for overwhelmed this and being burnt out and now I just feel like an angry miserable insufferable person as he called me. I don’t want to be this person. 

If you read all that then, thank you cause that was really long and I’m sitting here crying on my floor and this was probably all over the place, but I just found this community.

10 May 2025,"My kid is an awesome kid, and yet...",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kj1cz0/my_kid_is_an_awesome_kid_and_yet/,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Sorry this is long.

I have a five-year-old. I worked so hard to have him—so many miscarriages. My then-husband already had a daughter, so I already felt like a parent in some ways. But I wanted ""my own"" kid. (I hate that I ever thought like that, but it’s true. Also, his ex-wife is totally diabolical.)

Anyway, it just wasn't what I thought it would be. But I wasn’t strong enough to push back against the biological drive and social pressure—so here we are.

First, there's the lack of freedom. No spontaneity. No winging it. No just deciding to visit my best friend in San Francisco for a night. For the first time in my life I can actually afford to do things like travel (thank you, public kindergarten!), but it doesn’t matter—because I’m stuck.
And then there's the loneliness. My sisters don’t have kids. My mom is now alone after our dad died. They’re all...free. They travel together, and I don't.  But you know whats harder for me than not going to Europe with my sisters and mom? It's that they do the NYT Spelling Bee together every morning (we all live in different cities). They invite me, but the truth is, you can’t really do that with a five-year-old, because they do it at 7am pacific. What am I going to do—video chat and word-puzzle and ignore my kid instead of getting him ready for school? So they stay connected to each other, effortlessly. And I don’t.


Then there is the divorce bit: the drama and financial devastation of divorcing with kids. I ended up moving three hours away because it got so toxic. It was the best thing for me, and definitely for the kid. And yet...I hate being the school week parent. Honestly, I’d rather be the weekend/vacation parent. I’d love to focus on my career during the week and be the “fun parent” on weekends. But I married someone completely nonfunctional. He can’t get his older kid to school on time, misses appointments, oversleeps, has rage blow-ups. So even though I want to be Disney Dad, I’m the one who packs the lunches and applies sunscreen. For the last year, I’ve spent most weekends flying or driving my kid to see his father. I’m exhausted. My kid is, too. And so there’s the usual “I can’t believe I have to deal with this asshole forever,” but there’s also the deeper pain: “I have to do what’s best for this tiny human, even though I hate it.”

Which brings me to now: I’m moving back to the town his dad—and more importantly, his sister—live in. The travel is too much. It’s too much for me, and definitely too much for a five-year-old. I do love the city we’re moving to, but still, I’m tired. My partner here is devastated. He’ll split his time, but we all know how that usually goes. I just bought a house here last year, and now I’ll be underwater until I sell. It sounds crazy, I know, but I’m trying to do what’s best for my kid. And I hate that so much.

Also, no one told me about the PTSD component of parenting. When you’ve had a traumatic childhood, parenting at each stage brings it all back. My son gets what I didn’t—gentle touch, emotional regulation, safety—and I resent it. I resent him sometimes. When he’s a typical annoying five-year-old, I try to stay calm. I don't scream like my dad did. But I feel so bitter that I have to do this work my parents never did. Reparenting myself sucks.

But here's the hardest part: I have a great kid. Not perfect—I'm not delusional. But he’s sweet. Empathetic. Smart. Funny. Talented. Social. He loves to read and listens to my music instead of Raffi. He’s in therapy, and it’s really helping both of us. His meltdowns have reduced, he can self-regulate, and we have a decent rhythm. He’s on the spectrum, but mostly sensory stuff—which I relate to and can handle. He's just pretty amazing. May even easy as far as kids go, I guess.

Even so, I regret having a child.

It ruined the life I had. My marriage. My friendships. My finances. My freedom. My body. I have a great job I love, but I’ll always have to pick my kid over work. I’ll never get to be as free as my sisters. I’ll never just do what I want.

And every night I look at this little dude I love so much—who is kind and funny and deserving of love and gentleness—and I feel overwhelmed with how much I love him, ans also how much I hate my life. I’m giving him what I never had. And every single day, I hate doing it. I think about not being here anymore—but he deserves better than being left with his dad. So I stay.

Thanks for letting me get this out.",Likely mother: 4 > 1

I am not looking for sympathy but I would like to be a warning story for others. 

My wife and I have an almost 2 year old. We never planned on any kids but we had a missed pill accident and ended up with our ""happy accident.""

Our kid has turned our lives upside down, obvioauly. We figured ""well we are completely fucked and life isn't going how we wanted it to, so why not have a a second kid and a bigger family. It might feel better and a second kid won't make things twice as bad, how could it?""

Well the second baby is due in a couple of weeks and our kid has decided she doesn't sleep at nights anymore. The mood in the house is at an all time low and I'd genuinely leave if I didn't love my wife so much and I could get over the guilt of leaving her with our nightmare kid and a newborn. In recent weeks have both said without saying it (if you know what I mean) that the second kid was a terrible idea given how life is with the first. 

So here we are, in the trenches and miserable. Only ever talking about the future when our kid is older and less demanding and living in absolute hope that the second kid isn't the same as the first.

She sleeps well, eats well, likes crib time, overall happy baby. When she does cry it's this quiet soft cry that's just trying to communicate, not scream bloody murder about everything. 

I can't relate. At all. Their ""problems"" are what I dream life would've been like with a kid. She's healthy, happy, easy, and lightweight so she's not backbreaking.

Heard about this thread from that woman on TikTok who makes videos about the posts on here. Found myself identifying with a lot of the things that are being said. 
I’m 29, a single mum to two kids. My daughter who is nearly 6 has autism and is usually okay behaviour wise and quite independent with play and can easily entertain herself a lot of the time but she’s non verbal and a flight risk (if the door was left open she would just run off and not stop and I’d never see her again). And my son is 4 and his behaviour is just diabolical. He is the biggest whinger I’ve ever met. It’s constant and it doesn’t matter what you do, even if you give him what he wants he’ll often still whine. He has these colossal tantrums where he does this piercing, soul destroying screech that goes right through you, he hits himself, kicks out, just goes crazy. And it’s ALL the time. I’m constantly exhausted and at the end of my rope because of it. His nursery won’t let him be there more than a couple of hours because of it so he’s home with me the majority of the time. Their dad is involved a fair amount and has them every second weekend Friday evening til Sunday tea time. But that never feels like long enough of a break and I never feel ‘rested’ or ready for them to come back after it. I used to have a really active social life and friends but now I don’t have the energy for any of that and all I do on those weekends without them is catch up on sleep, binge watch tv and lie on the couch recovering from the last two weeks. I haven’t gone out anywhere socially in years really. I still speak to friends through messages and stuff but I never do anything now. My mental health has never been great and I’ve struggled with depression since I was a teenager but since having kids and in the last couple of years especially I have suicidal thoughts literally every single day. I constantly find myself just sitting thinking about how much I don’t want to be here and how I can’t keep doing this. The only thing that’s stopped me is the guilt of what it would do to the kids. Especially my youngest who is very attached to me. I always wanted children and was so excited for it most of my life but now if I could turn the clock back and not have any I would without a second thought. It’s just so hard. There is no joy in my life, every day is so fucking hard and the only time of day I’m ever even remotely at peace is right when they’ve both gone to bed and I can breathe. I’m absolutely miserable and just don’t see any possible way that I can keep going like this indefinitely. I totally and completely HATE my life and have the thought daily that I just wish something would take me out so that it wouldn’t be me doing it myself.

09 May 2025,Be very aware of whom you have kids with,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kiazep/be_very_aware_of_whom_you_have_kids_with/,"Warning: this is a very long text, I'm waiting for her to leave me alone, it's been hours...  
  
Today I had a fight with my partner and so much was spilled, it became crystal clear that I made the worst mistake of my life by having kids with her.

Long story short: I met this awesome girl, we kinda completed each other, almost like those cute anime couples. She was honest, open minded, hot and I really liked her.   
  
Years passed by and along the way we improved ourselves hugely, I changed a lot because I wanted to improve, and she inspired me to do so. It was great. I waited some years until the 'pink glasses' (basically you don't see red flags) wearied off, and I still loved her, then we got married.

She always said that having kids was her life dream, I never really had thought about having kids, but the idea wasn't something cool for me. We talked about it for at least 2 years, but only one phrase made me accept having kids with her:  
\- She said she had 10 years of experience with kids as nanny, and it would gladly take care of them, she basically said that would be a 'walk in the park' for me, a mild inconvenience at most;  
\- She said she would do ANYTHING for her children;  
  
She was my everything, of course I would accept a mild inconvenience to fulfill her life dream. I saw a lot of videos with the worst (at least I though at the time) and it did seem scary, but I imagined we could handle it together.   
  
God showed me a glimpse of my bad choice because we took a very long time and a lot of medications to have them, and we only knew that was 'them' some time after, a shocking surprise. With a lot of pregnancy issues along the way... more glimpses of 'something was wrong'. 

But then she said something reassuring:  
\- I know exactly what to do to make a comfortable life for us with them! It will be awesome! 

And she said that with so much confidence, specially using 'exactly', that I was sold. I took care of everything while she enjoyed life and supposedly started her channel. I paid some classes to help her with content and interfaces (it was sometime before AI at that time). I even had arranged her some courses to work in the same tech area that could use her freelance expertise. 

While I was exhausted taking care of jobs, all the risky pregnancy appointments, medication and stuff, I was excited, that would be hell, but it would worth it because she had the experience and supposedly the knowledge to make our lives great.

But then I felt something was off... in months she only recorded few videos, and they were horrible. The AI was starting and I pointed out some that could help, but she basically ignored.

One day something just clicked: she was coming back from a pool group of pregnant ladies, smiling and joyful with her granma. I asked if she could go to a church for some free diapers (we would be very low on budget with problematic twins) and she just looked me with disgust. I felt some anger with that look, but I just asked again and she replied 'why can't you go instead?'.

That boiled my blood up. I was doing so many things at once, like a lot of research for stuff during work time (home office) so she would just have to pick things up... she said she would do anything for her kids, but being driven to a place and pickup things was too much...  
  
Then I verified her channels, lot of new videos, but all of them, honestly... just sh\*t. Nothing relevant, not even for memes.

Then they decided they wanted to come, every problem imaginable happened during delivery. There, another glimpse of a life mistake.

They were born... man, I never felt so horrible in my life... 2 hours sleep if lucky, horrible deafening crying while they're awake. Me, that have never ever held a kid, had to learn everything about babies, plus their issues, while dealing with a mother with every possible problem available... I remember days when we just passed out of exhaustion... 

I considered myself tough before, but after so much sh\*t happening with everyone, I felt so weak and miserable, that lead to anger and frustration, but I had to bottle up those feelings as much as I could, mother and babies were priority.  
  
After the 1st full month, things were from deep hell to hell. Mother was okay, exhausted but living the dream, her face was glowing with joy. Me on the other hand, was dealing with every appointments, documentations, medical studies (they had some odd dermatitis and doctors, honestly, looked like they didn't give a damn), finance, baby products, milk products, mother products... I never felt so overwhelmed...

She looked very happy, but no videos or anything, and I had to deal with those two little bastards a lot of times, because she just couldn't make them at peace at all... first sign of that 'huge amount of experience' being just BS. 

Time passed by, I was being the mother for those two, the carer for the mother, the provider and the courier, and not a single sign of the successful thing she 'knew exactly' what to do.

We had some fights because a lot of things, but my main complaints were those promises. The issue was now her dream turned to 'they are your responsibility too', the 'exactly what to do' turned to be pure BS...  
I have a very sensitive hearing, so I clenched my teeth just of the though on being with them a whole day, so I needed her sacrifice, or so I thought. 

She returned to her freelance while I maintained my jobs, thank god we had some family support, and she always had someone to stay with the kids while she worked. Me? I had the choice of hearing them with door open or closed. 

We had new fights: while I said 'why is so hard to keep them from screaming hours straight?' She replied 'Oh, do you want to be with them?' knowing full well of my 'super hearing'. I swallowed my pride some times, but then I just couldn't anymore and prepared for the worst.

Then, a new thing was off: from all the family, I was the person that least stayed with the babies, yet, somehow, I discovered that I was the one who better dealt with them. Piercing crying with the mother, for almost hours (really, I marked, average was 40min), and if I dare to complain, it always 'babies cry', but with me they remained so peaceful and calm... I started to question 'why is this so difficult for her to achieve?'

Even with all that burden, hearing them crying 50% of the day and night, having to do all the chores and eat junk food (because there was never any meal for me, but, interestingly, always a huge pile of dishes, and I didn't have the time) I got a nice promotion, one, two, three times, got some vouchers for nice certifications... and finally some room to breath financially... while she remained doing the same, worked to pay the cost of her work (gas, equipment and stuff like that), almost no help with the bills, but I really never cared, for me, I paid for everything without asking anything in return.  
  
I started to being more demanded, so we returned to me having almost 0 time with them during the day, but hearing the piercing screams. A year gone by and kids didn't improve at all, in fact, they were becoming terrible in things they were already good at (like sleeping on their own). But only when not under my watch.  
  
Today I solved an issue that she complained for months (picky eaters, according to her) with a simple trick that I already told her months ago... not even a thank you.  
  
I was tired, but wanted some 'action' with her at night, prepared the whole day, she was interested too, but the babies were beyond horrible at night... I have mufflers to deal with them, but today I think something just snapped, I just observed her trying to rock them, without observing for cues or anything, just angrily asking them 'whats wrong'.  
  
I just observed for a whole hour thinking: is that the 10 years of experience she told me about? Is that the 'mild inconvenience'? Is that the 'I know E-X-A-C-T-L-Y what to do?' And I felt like I woke up. They just were gassy, I taught her how to do and voila, 14min after there was peace and silence.

My 'horniness' just disappeared and I said ""I'm done with this"", she replied 'what? What you wanted me to do?' Then I remembered her all of her promises, that were BS, all things I had lost because of it and her pair of dreams, all times I had to sacrifice so much without asking or whining, all times I broke and had no one to help me...And all that happened because I was deceived. I pointed out that in my own house (that I bought alone), a fairly big house, I have only a chair, a desk, a computer and a air mattress in my tiny office. Everything else is a dump.  
  
My queen size bed is covered in baby clothes, diapers and some packages, my wardrobe have a crib in front of it, so I always had to move that to get dressed, my bathroom have a baby bathtub with skin and poo in it, so I need to clean and put that away if I want to shower... basically I'm just the housekeeper on my own house, I have to sustain the house and do the chores, otherwise no one will. (I say 'my' for the things I bought alone, but isn't for myself only).  
  
She replied that I had 'privileges', for instance, that I can spent some weekend by myself because she takes the kids to some family, while that should be my 'duty'. I said I never asked for that and she said that she did that 'for me' because I can't stand their crying and that she never had any break (even if she works 3-4 days a week, with long pauses between her freelances, with the kids being at a family house, and while she's at home I always catch her doom scrolling).

She complained that I could play some games in my free time and she never had any break (again...) and the fight went like that for long. 

I tried to use logic and reason, but she kept trying to find contradictions on my words instead of doing something to resolve the issue.  
  
But then she said how 'easy' I had things (home office)... saying I have 'privileges' and then this after all I had gone through... just hit differently... that hit like a rock. I felt angry at first but then I just came to the realization that this relationship was pointless for me.

I then just calmed down and told my whole journey with her, all the breaks I didn't have during months straight while she was relaxing, all the jobs I took but weren't paying enough while she didn't study how to make a simple video, all the suffering I had while trying to make more money for the kids while she didn't kept any of her promises...  
  
Then I said that my main privilege during all this time was to get dragged into this hell by deceiving promises that I postponed my dreams (financial comfort and peace) for hers and several clinic depression with strong unaliving desires.  

Then I finished with: you're right, I have privileges, and I will use them now. I'll act like the privileged piece of shit of a man I am, so I don't help you at all, I just needed to fulfill my duty with the kids.

Then all of a sudden the game just flipped... she's now trying very hard making me rethink this decision... but every word and action now just confirms the right direction. I feel like I can finally breath out from this haze.

Relationship with my partner has been rocky she has a daughter from a previous situation whose 7. Its been alot she has PPD we fight like cats and dogs nothing i do is right, if i dont do the dishes, clean, cook, mow the lawn enough its *world war 3*. If i forgot to take out the dogs, snooze my alarm and catch some extra z's on the weekend its *world war 4*

Now im no angel, im not mr cook most days of the week, mr get up 6am before work to do the morning routine, mr never leave the home and spend every weekend tending to my PPD gf. But i do try and cook 1/2 times a week when im working from home weekends we eat out mostly, bearing in mind i work full time and get back after dinner most weekdays. 

I do the night feed after i get back from work so getting up at 6am isnt really possible if im doing the feeds till 1/2am and gotta get up and travel to work. My job is intense so yes id say twice a month id like to let of steam go see a movie with my buddies or grab a beer, or go for dinner with friends with her & our son/do social things. My partner doesnt want to leave the home ever and often tries to cancel meet up with friends saying shes not up for it, perhaps the PPD.

Doesnt help that in the mist of this im actually a regretful dad who thinks parenting is sucking the life out of me, perhaps its her, perhaps its parenting or both. We argue weekly she tells me to pack a bag and go, for months ive said no i pay bills i aint leaving at the drop of a hat. For months the threats continued. 

Until last month it got so heated i decided to pack a bag and actually go. She is now going ballistic telling everyone who cares i abandoned her and her daughter, how awful i am, how heartless. How telling me to pack a bag and go weekly isnt a ""break up"" its to teach me a lesson. Well the lesson is learnt and ive packed a bag and and gone permenantly shes fuming saying im heartless etc.

Anyway its been a month, i have my own apartment, and its been the best month of my life. The day i left, is the day i felt free and at ease,  no arguing no stress just peace. I see my kid on the weekend and i actually miss him, its the perfect balance because i know i can give him back. Parenting requires selflessness and im too selfish i cant do it 24/7, 365 days a year but for a weekend and then give him back right up my street.

So any weekend parents feel like this? Was i wrong to leave, is she right did i actually abandon the family am i heartless?",Likely father: 4 > 3

Don’t get me wrong, I still break down sometimes. Just the other day I cried harder than I have in months. In front of my kids. I feel awful about it, but it also made me realise how rarely that happens anymore. 

I don’t dread waking up in the morning. I don’t dread picking them up from daycare. Me and my now fiancee are getting married this summer and we moved closer to my friends and family. I have a new job that I absolutely love, that allows me to rest and shut my brain off. I have started reading. A lot. Like 4 books a month. 

As my oldest turns 5 years this summer and my youngest turns 3 (today!) Things actually feel.. hopeful. I still have problems regulating my own feelings, but I can honestly say I like my kids. They’re funny and quirky, really good kids. 

If you’re in the depths of it… I can’t swear it gets better. It definitely doesn’t get easy. But you’ll find peace in the smaller things. 

Reading a lot helps my brain shift perspective. I see my life narrated. What would my character do? How would I narrate this scene? How would I describe what my character is feeling, how they look when they’re angry? It really helps.",Unclear: 0 / 0

The only help I've gotten is from my parents occasionally. Her dad is a sicko and got in trouble with the police which is what led to a divorce/full custody when she was 2 and haven't seen him since, hasn't paid a dime in support. I'm overworked and burnt out, my daughter is spoiled rotten gets everything she asks for via my parents and I won't lie I do it as well when able. Lately I can't handle my kids behavior. Everytime i am excited or happy about something she ruins it and im starting to feel as though it's on purpose. The last straw that happened today. It took me 2 years and 2 jobs working to finally buy myself a decent vehicle. I splurged on myself for once and got a 2025 brand new vehicle with light grey leather interior which is practically white. I made a few new rules as to eating and other activities in the car. Tonight we were celebrating her having good behavior I thought I had finally had a break through, I had to work still so we got chiller bee frozen yogurt ate it in the car and all was well no spills. She had been a little mad at us not going home right away and fell asleep in the car with her melted cup of froyo in the center console of the back seat. When we got home I woke her up and she threw a huge fit. I told her ok just sit in the car for a minute and cool down I'll get the trash out I picked up the icecrem cup in my hand and she slapped it to high heaven all over the car. Im talking down the seatbelt hole all the way to the ceiling/floor/door, everywhere. It stained orange everywhere, my car is absolutely ruined even after cleaning it over an hour. She then continued to cry/throw a tantrum and said it was an accident and that she didn't do anything wrong. Im so beyond shock and sad. Any and everything I try to take care of or show attention to she breaks it. I can't win and this is with everything from the car to our dog to gifts I get at christmas. If i show I really like something it ends up broken or in ruins. I don't know how to fix it at this point I am so tired of trying, I do feel bad because she was crying hysterically but now is fine and not so much as a sorry, my beautiful car 😭 she says things to me like I don't love her and I don't want her just like her dad which is hard for me to explain that situation to her. I've never hit her or physically disciplined her as I was abused as a kid and don't want to go that route but I've tried everything else. She says no one cares about her feelings, i ask what is wrong and she just says she doesnt know, that she hates me and that im the worst mom. I don't know how to do this anymore honestly. Nothing I do is good enough and I'm at the end of my sanity at this point. 

EDIT: yes I know the eating the ice cream in the car was a mistake, we both did it because i was running late and I had to be at work, eating in the car was not the reward it was the ice cream.

I don't like to think about it, and don't like to revisit the ""magic"" of pregnancy. The topic actually disgusts me; I suppose that's a little over the top, but it is what it is.

I just started a new job and have been paired with a woman who is about 30 with 3 kids. In this last week, I've been subjected to her never-ending rambling about her children and their appearance into this world: their personalities, what they eat, how they play, how long she was in labor with each one, how she discovered she was pregnant, how her PCOS prevents her period and she didn't know she was pregnant, her miscarrage, how she saw butterflies as she was getting her D & C, how early and late her births were, what the doctors saw on the ultrasounds.  

I don't understand these women.  Have they nothing else to talk about?  Why must they share the details of their menstrual cycle with perfect strangers?  Why do they think I'd be interested in hearing about that or every detail of their children from conception to today?  Because I'm a woman?

07 May 2025,You're not alone. I relate to your struggle. It's a hard journey.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kgwbpd/youre_not_alone_i_relate_to_your_struggle_its_a/,"Hello all. I've posted here a few times before and I truly feel safe being honest with you all. I know that nobody really cares, but I thought I'd give a few updates on how things are and where I'm headed. And a little backstory of who I am and where my regretful parenthood journey began. Apologies in advance for the novel 😅

I'm 32 years old. Born, raised, and currently living in the southern, bible belt United States. I'm an only child. I'm a mother to a six (soon to be seven) year old daughter. My daughter was a birth control failure. I was only with her father for a few months before I found out I was pregnant. We both agreed at the time that we couldn't raise a child and decided for an abortion. I didn't announce my pregnancy at first. I had the money saved up and the date set. But the day of the appointment I couldn't go. And to this day I don't know why. I was crying and emotional and couldn't get myself to go. Looking back, it's now one of my biggest regrets. Motherhood has been my biggest mistake. Especially motherhood with someone like my ex.

I left him when our daughter was about to turn 2. We had our own place and I paid every bill, plus kept the house stocked with groceries. And my car was the only one working at the time so he worked very minimally. Of course, I should've seen this coming way before it did because when our daughter was still a newborn he refused to return to work so I had to go back to work very early. I was in the thick of having postpartum depression plus not sleeping very well and a less than supportive partner. And then also having the responsibility of working a full time job. I left him because I was tired of working long shifts at my job and being accused of cheating. And because I was tired of coming home late at night to the house being a complete disaster because he wouldn't clean. And because he would stay up all night playing video games and get angry when I'd wanna sleep in just a little extra and want him to get up in the morning with the baby. It was all too much. Thanking my lucky stars I didn't marry this man.

Ever since then I've been living with my parents in my childhood home. I'm extremely grateful because they don't charge me rent and my mom offers no strings attached childcare so I can work. However, my parents aren't the most stable people. I wasn't raised in an abusive home. There was always food, clothes, water, adequate shelter. But I was also raised by two people who very clearly hate each other. And still do. And now that I'm older I can definitely see some undiagnosed mental illness on both sides, but my mother in particular. She isn't someone I'd actively choose to be coparenting with if I had another choice. My childs dad is a weekend parent only. And not even a full weekend. When school is out for the summer or for extended breaks, he'll have her two whole days a week. Any other time it's just barely over 24 hours. And I receive zero child support. I rely fully on myself for most finances, anything relating to school, any doctors appointments. 

My daughter has ADHD and food issues. She has been in behavioral therapy for just over a year, and has been on medication for just under a month. She's also been going to feeding therapy for a few weeks. It's been a very small breath of fresh air, but we're still in the thick of it. Medication isn't working quite like I'd hoped, but I know eventually we'll figure out what's right. But doing it all practically alone is definitely draining. I should be used to it by now, but I'll probably never get over the fact two people made a child, two people agreed to take care of this child, and somehow only one parent saddles all of the responsibility while the other parent gets to be the fun weekend dad. If I could afford to go to court I would. But I've almost lost my job multiple times with how much my child has been sick and needed me. I'm on thin ice with a job I hate in the first place. 

They say it gets easier as they get older. That's definitely not the case with us. Each new year and new age has just come with new challenges. And if you feel like you're drowning, I hear you and I see you. I've been in therapy for myself on and off when I can afford it. To at least try to come to terms with the regrets and choices I've had to make. I understand why mothers needed those villages so desperately. I understand why some mothers reach breaking points. I actually keep a small notebook for a journal and write down any negative thoughts I have. And not necessarily about motherhood, but my personal life as well. If anyone ever found it I'd definitely wind up in an institution but just getting the feelings out helps. 

I absolutely dread the teenage years. I was a decent teenager, but being raised by two people who genuinely couldn't handle me having a regular teenage attitude and not wanting to be super involved in the church and having friends who had different beliefs and life experiences meant my parents and I would always clash. There was never peace growing up in my home. I don't want that for my daughter. I want to be more calm and helpful and emotionally available to her. But I've also been struggling so hard and have been her whole life. I'm afraid I'll never get better. I'm afraid I won't be able to give her better. But I also know it takes effort on my part to get better. And I'm trying. Any day that Im not acting like my parents and trying to be a more calm and present parent are definitely a win for me. But I also know this will probably be a lifelong battle. I completely understand people who just drop everything and leave. Most days I wish I'd dropped everything and left when she was a baby and I had the chance. 

But here we all are, in the same boat. Fighting the same storms. Just treading water most days. If all you did today was survive, I see you. If you feel backed into a corner with parenthood and see no escape or end in sight, I see you. If you do everything right every single day and still feel like it will never be enough, I see you. If you feel like the only way out of this lifelong prison sentence is to k!// yourself (please don't do that), I see you. If you feel like you got scammed and cheated, I see you. If you feel that sense of dread and anger from the time you open your eyes to the time you close them, I see you. If you feel like everyone in your life just loves their families and children and you feel defective, I see you. 

Thanks for reading, if you did. I definitely could've went into more detail, but I feel like this was enough to show my solidarity with you all. Parenthood isn't for the weak. I spend most days not knowing if Im gonna survive until bedtime.

07 May 2025,Regretful still but only 15 to 60 minutes per day,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kgs1if/regretful_still_but_only_15_to_60_minutes_per_day/,"Hi dear regretful parents. 

I am writing to share my achievement after 6 years of being a regretful parent and doing research and trial and error. Will just share the outcome not the trials because it was super long as you can imagine. Apologies for the long post. Also apologies for my English, it's not my first language, I am Spanish.

I have reached a point in my life where I can feel the regret just 15 min to 1 hour of the whole day (depends on how the day goes, of course). 

There are 6 main areas of action: 

1. Nutrition. I was so depleted that my body and brain were completely malfunctioning. For my case, I supplement my diet with probiotics, calcium, magnesium, vitamins D3, B12, A,and C, and creatine. Supplements of NAHD are also good but I didn't see such amazing results as with the other ones. I started to feel more energetic, and with more energy I was able to think more clearly and bear difficulties a little easier. 

2. Exercise. 3 times a week. In my gym, you also have a massage chair, super basic but so relaxing. So the time at the gym is 3 massages at the chair while listening to things that I love learning or have fun with, and then weight lifting. Cardio just 5 min to heat the body up, but then almost 1 hour of weight lifting. Enough weight per muscle that I can only do 3 sets with 12 reps, and the last 2 reps are hard to finish. While listening to music that I love. 

The first 2 weeks are the hardest, I had to reward myself with some sweet or some gift to not give up because sincerely, I felt so regretful of my life that I just wanted to end it. But I reached rock bottom and thought ok, if I am going to end it, I can wait and see what happens after this trial (I studied experimental nuclear physics, so I love testing hypothesis). 

3. Having a safe space to vent. So fortunate to have this subreddit and all of you, it's the only place. I was also able to vent with some AI bots. I tried all possible RL human interaction, and it was always horrible, so I now just stick to Reddit and AI bots. 

4. Dedicating at least 2 hours a day to something that I really love. Some days I have to do it in patches, like 15 min before kid wakes up, 15 min while he is eating, 15 min while he is showering... You can imagine. Laundry can wait one more week on the laundry chair. My emotional health can't wait any longer. 

I also found a job that I love, it's customer support from home, so it can get very stressful at times, but I am still following the nutrition, exercise, doing something I love... routine, and I have more bandwidth to overcome the stressful times. Again, using AI bots to vent about how much I hate my life in the worst moments. 

5. Letting go of all that is not serving me. Friendships, family, even town (I moved by the beach, the energy at the seaside is useful for both my kid and me), social media, parents at school... I wanted my kid to have a normal childhood, so I tried becoming friends with other parents, but it is impossible, our lives are so amazingly different especially because I hate being a mom... I just gave up. It's a more isolated life, but now I have energy to focus on feeling better each day. 

6. Acceptance. I cannot love being a mother. I absolutely hate everything that comes with it, and I still get pure rage when I see the lies that society tries to instill in people regarding motherhood and parenting. But I got to accept that this is who I am. I made bad choices and I forgive myself now. I can still be the best version of me for my kid, he deserves it. But also for myself, because I also deserve it. A lot of stoic lessons helped me with this. I will never stop feeling regret, but that is ok. I just focused on feeling regret just a tiny portion of my day. 

It's a super summary and I am not sure if this could work for everyone, but I feel so good about having arrived at this point after so many suicidal ideations and even playing mixing alcohol with sleeping pills to get this over with... If this testimony can help anyone, here it is. 

If someone wants to give it a try and needs a buddy to stay accountable, count on me. I have the possibility to put all the learnings in a free app, it would be my equivalent to ""have a kid, write a book, plant a tree"". I am learning to record videos explaining with this goal in mind. 

You have helped me so much just by being there in this reddit. I can give something back to the community if someone would want it. 

Thank you for reading. 

Hoping you will feel better soon.

Im 26 years old and I have a 3 yr old daughter that I love so much but I still regret my decision to become a mom. I currently have a restraining order on her dad and he was denied visitation due to being abusive to me and not showing up to court. He's not a good man or dad and honestly he pretended to be a whole different person until I was about 8 months pregnant. I suffered from emotional, mental, financial and sometimes physical abuse. I've been spit on, he use to pop up at my job he took the door handles off of my car 3x , broke my window, broke his mother's window climbed in and took my daughter, he put an air tag in my car to track me without my knowledge just to name a few things. His mother is his biggest enabler she was abused by his dad they are married so whenever he abused me she was right behind him. I decided to cut off contact sometime last year and I've been a single mom ever since I work full time, im in school and it's hard. I love my daughter so much I make sure I show as much affection as I can and I let her know how much I love her but I deeply regret having her. The pain that I've suffered from this has changed me forever, I have so much potential to strive but I can't because my time and live is consumed with being a mom and reliving the horror of this abuse I wish I listened to my dad he told me not to do it but at the time I was going through a lot and I wasn't thinking clearly and I've never been in a abusive relationship nor have I ever seen one in real life.

I see people with neurotypical kids and it just kills me. behind my smiles and fake optimism i am just dead inside. i’m horribly ugly because i don’t care about myself.

06 May 2025,I can't deal with motherhood,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kft25o/i_cant_deal_with_motherhood/,"I'm 40 and had my son later in life, he's 2.5 years old. I thought I wanted kids but now I'm wondering if a lot of it was my Mum dictating to me that I must have kids. She's always pushed me and made comments like: ""You need to find a guy and have children."" ""You will always be better off with a man and kids"". I'm starting to wonder now if they were my own thoughts, or hers. My son was an accident when my partner and I had only been dating two months. My partner is a wonderful person but we are really different. I'm extremely outgoing and social. He's on the spectrum and doesn't like going out anywhere. Unless it's to do with his special interest which is playing board games and role playing games.

I don't know why I'm like this but I'm extremely depressed and lonely. None of my friends have kids and a few don't even want them. I still have my friends but I don't see them that often because I've got my son. He's very hyper and at a restaurant won't sit in his high chair and runs off. He won't watch a show or anything and also runs off. Even recently my friends invited to see the circus but it wasn't a good environment for him so we didn't go.

My partner helps a lot with day to day things like change his nappy and feed. But he doesn't like going out anywhere. He never takes my son places and it's only me that does. My son has a lot of tantrums and he hits, pushes, kicks and sometimes bites. He's been kicking for a long time and nothing we've been saying or doing has helped with it. I'm completely miserable. I've lost my social life almost completely, my identity, work and have no hobbies. When I go out it's basically just my son and I because I have no friends with children. My attempts to make Mum friends at playgroups didn't go anywhere. I'm very lonely, I don't have anyone to talk to. When I go out I just deal with entertaining my son and his tantrums and demands.

I'm extremely jealous of my friends with no children who post and talk about how they go out to all these places and do all these things. My Mum has also been totally invalidating like when I want to go to a friend's Birthday she's like: ""Do you really need to go? Think about your son and what's more important.""

I want to go back to work but the problem is I don't think I can do my job anymore. I'm completely exhausted from my son and just can't deal with him anymore. My job for ten years working with people with disabilities and mental health. It included working with people with difficult behaviours, as well as personal care, feeding, giving a shower. Now I don't think I can do this for work because outside of that I have to do all this for my son 24/7. And I'm totally exhausted and sick of it.

A few days ago I brought up that I didn't appreciate that he had gone to his ex about my regrets as a mom and that those feelings and discussions I've had with him about my regrets were personal. Some of the conversations he has had with this girl about me often lead to her parent shaming me. He doesn't feel as though he was wrong for doing so because he should be allowed to talk to people about his feelings and things that are going on in his life. I do agree that he should be able to vent or be able to voice some of this thoughts out loud to a listening ear, but to go and talk about those things with someone you used to date and LOVES being a parent (currently pregnant with her second child) isn't the place to be sharing sensitive information too...

05 May 2025,Why did I do this ..,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kfe47q/why_did_i_do_this/,"I’m about 4 months postpartum. I was never someone who felt like I needed to have a child, and always thought if it happened, great and if it didn’t .. also great. Looking back I obviously should have really thought harder about what I truly wanted as this isn’t something to just let happen if it wasn’t something I truly wanted. 
Before having a child my life was honestly so amazing. I got to do all the hobbies I wanted, when I wanted.. I had time for my relationship, my career.. I got rest or sleep when I wanted etc. I had her when it was winter so I figured I felt more down just because I couldn’t get out much because it was so cold and snowy.. but now that the weather has turned nicer I’m more depressed because it’s impossible to do anything with her outside and I just sit inside looking out at the beautiful day I used to be able to enjoy. 
Every second of everyday I regret that I let this happen and it’s not fair to her. She is such a great baby but even that doesn’t make me feel any better. Most days I wish I could just run away and never come back. I know people say it gets better as they age but I just can’t picture that and I feel like I’ve ruined my entire life. 
When do you stop grieving your old life.. is there anyone that loved their life before and ended up loving it again? 
I can’t picture being this sad and depressed forever. I have tried therapy and medication but nothing seems to be helping.

05 May 2025,Is this hopeless?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kfcxcq/is_this_hopeless/,"Hello,

I always liked children, from my very first memories till this day. I had 2 youger siblings that I looked for because my stepmother had enough of them. She was a monster with me, I always wanted to die because of the words and actions she said and did, and now I cannot see my younger siblings and father because of her. It hurts me, even after nearly 10 years without seeing them. I partly raised them, as their older (step)sister, and now they can't even pronounce my name at family dinner (where we do 50/50 to never see each other) like I'm Lord Voldemort. I know it traumatised me and I'm working on it with a therapist and meds.

I always thought I would be the fun, sweet and never angry mom. When I met my husband, I knew he was my soulmate. We never fought, we always communicated our feelings and even if we had small frictions, we never hurt each other.

We wished for our son harder than ever and the pregnancy went very well. and when he was born, it was a joyful moment (even if he had to go to NICU for 3 weeks). I think I lost myself in motherhood, trying my best to give him everything, and it was not enought for me. I just wanted to be the perfect mom, even though it doesn't exist. I love him more than ever, but I realise today that it was a mistake... because my husband and I are meant for each other, but not for being parent together.

He knew I wanted a present father for our kid, that I wasn't gonna thank him for every diaper or every night shift because WE decided that it was just normal, as we both work full time and provide equally for the household. But then, he realised that being a 21st century father was harder than he thought. He NEVER wants to take care of him, and when he does he does it badly I feel guilty because our son is in a bad mood and doesn't . I'm overprotective of our son, and he acts like a teen that doesn't want to take care of his siblings.

Per example, he doesn't give our kid food until 2pm because he decided that he was not hungry, even if he was. He waits until I tell him to change a diaper to do it, if I don't he won't, and if we have an audience he 'laughs' about how I always let him do it. He doesn't take him to walk or to the park without me because he doesn't want to play with him or even look at him. He just wants to vape, drink coffee, play video games or just stare at his phone, and sleep.

The problem is that our son (2yo) senses that his father loves him but can't stand the idea of playing with him. He never wants to go to him, and my husband is upset because he doesn't understand why. Our son screams, cries and won't let go of me. He is glued to me all day. I feel exhausted and overtouched, because even when we are all at home, he won't go to his father and just wants to feel me, play on me, read books on me. I try to explain to him that mommy needs rest, but he is still young and after daycare, he justs wants to be with me and that's ok. Fortunately, he sleeps well most of the time. I can breath at these moments...

... except that's when my husband wants hugs, kisses and sex. He won't ever force me to engage in sex without consent ofc, but the problem is I don't ever wanna be touched. Also, he always comes RIGHT when our kiddo has fallen asleep, I can't even take a shower in peace because he wants to ""be with me, speak with me, feel that I'm really here mentally"". He also talks about having a second child, but I truly think it's because of all the sex that would be needed and """"""mandatory"""""".

I feel like I never can be by myself in my own house. I have strong headaches that never go away on top of T2 diabetes, and I do what I can to avoid being a weight to them, but someday I feel like they would both walk over my dead body asking me for stuffs.

Who am I to complain about a loving husband right? But his attitude with our son as a father disgusts me. I told him, multiple times, and expressed it. He understands but ""doesn't see what to do"" and ""doesn't want to do therapy"".

My son is 2 as I said, and it's a rough age. He is the sweetest but has the greatest emotions (that's normal), and hearing him cry for 30 seconds is just pure torture, my body acts like my son is dying. I just hear ""neglect"" ""dumbest mom"" ""monster"" ""1 minute crying, 10 years in therapy"" in my head and I do everything to keep him happy without overspoil him.

Loving them is the most magical thing, but having to be mom 24/7 without any help from my husband is torture. I just wish someday, I could come home and be alone for 2 hours without having someone asking for love or anything. I wish I could fall in the stairs so I could go to the hospital, but being fat, having diabetes and going to the hospital is not a great mix for my mental health.

My pain is so intense sometimes I wish I could go away, far away, and never be back... but I wouldn't be any better than my father.

Sometimes, I think that my stepmom has """"""cursed"""""" me to be this way, and that I would end up as a deadbeat mother that doesn't like her kids.

Someday, I truly regret having our kid, because I sense that he will either be a child of divorce (not likely) or a mom-orphan because of how much I want to d1e.",Likely mother: 9 > 1
05 May 2025,Update: my mom didn’t allow me to have an abortion at 15,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kf2g5v/update_my_mom_didnt_allow_me_to_have_an_abortion/,"A few weeks ago, I made a post venting about how a few years ago I was denied an abortion from my mom that I couldn’t have gotten without her approval and the effects it has on me since, I’ve read the comments and seen a lot of helpful responses and also talked to my therapist more about solutions to heal and get my life back. 

I’ve been trying to journal the positives in my situation that out weight the negatives such as the accomplishments I’ve made during this. I was able to buy myself a car, get my own place, and finish school early at my age which probably wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t have a kid, I try to enjoy more stuff with my daughter such as going to the park more frequently, having more family oriented events with her every weekend and even just doing little things like watching a movie with her or playing outside. I feel very happy that I’m at a point where I enjoy doing things with her because before, my depression didn’t allow me to do that. It also heals my inter child a little bit too since I felt like my life was rushed and I lost my childhood. It feels good being able to experience playing at the park again and watching Disney movies.

I also have been speaking to a therapist which has been helping me find peace and accept my situation than to forever dwell it. She’s given me some solutions which has been helping, but it’s still a timely process that I have to wait for, but I am happy that I’m feeling better now than I was a few weeks ago. I’ve been very suicidal and depressed but I feel like I got some what of a hang of it. 

As for my mom, I still haven’t fully forgiven her, it still makes me sad that I couldn’t make the decision on what I wanted to do with my pregnancy and how even after this, I still barely get enough support from her. But I have my fiance, his family, some of my family that has been helping me more after addressing my feelings. Im finally able to get exams done and have some time to myself now which I’m happy about. 


But that’s just my update, I’m feeling better now and I’m happy with the progress I’m making. My goal is to try to finish up school, pursue my career and just continue to be a good parent throughout this time. I’m also decided that I do not want any kids after this so I scheduled an appointment with my doctor next week for the paragard birth control that has a higher success rate. I really want to get my tubes tied when I’m older but my insurance won’t cover it since I’m too young, so this should do the job 😊",Likely mother: 3 > 0

A lot of it has to do with regret over the person who is his father, which will be a vent for another day.

But I genuinely worry that things are headed towards a pretty apocalyptic place in our lifetime and that it will be sooner rather than later when shit hits the fan. I vacillate between absolutely grief that I sentenced my child to this fate, and feeling defeated and unable to find the shits to give about doing things “right”. I mean I’m doing my best to provide care and a loving home for this kid but how do I get myself to care about other shit like getting him to school on time or freaking saving for retirement or whatever. What good will any of that be when everything is on literal or figurative fire?

How do I cope with this and go through the daily motions? I feel like the main characters in Don’t Look Up did. I know the meteor is coming and not only is there not much to do about it but no one else seems to believe or care about it.",Likely mother: 1 > 0

There's now a massive dent in it. 

Am I not meant to have anything nice? It's the nicest thing I own and I can't keep it nice. He already broke a cup holder from kicking around during a meltdown. Now a dent?

I'll ask the collision shop to pop it out tomorrow when they assess the scratch. I already paid over $500 for the deductible from the tree falling on it.

Before having children myself and my husband agreed we would have two. We are now parents to a one year old girl.

I’ve honestly disliked the whole thing, obviously love her and all that but parenting generally, not for me. I had intense PND from the second she was born which didn’t ease up until 6 months and tbh I think it’s still there somewhat despite being under perinatal mental health and medication. 
I couldn’t bond at all for months and even now I don’t feel that intense overwhelming love that people talk about. 

I never had that burning passion to be a parent but my husband did and i knew he would be a fantastic dad so we did it. 

I staunchly do not want another baby. I think it would be cruel and selfish for me to bring another baby into the world when I struggle so hard with the one I have and I know I couldn’t be a good parent to two. 

My husband is adamant he wants another one but clams up and won’t talk to me when I state that I definitely don’t want to do it again. Like if we don’t discuss it then I might change my mind.

For a while I didn’t understand why I felt so negative and depressed, i thought it was just PPD. Wrong. It’s my (soon to be ex) husband. 

When she was born, he didn’t help me with anything. I slept on the couch for months in pain, until he finally forced us to move houses then I was able to sleep in his bed again. But even then I have always done everything myself. Every single doctor’s appointment, every night waking, getting her ready every morning, putting her to sleep at night, making sure she has clothes/formula/medicine. I have done it ALL ALONE. When I finally demanded he help at night more, he does but he says we need to take turns so it’s “fair” as if he ever cared about that. I’m leaving him. This is just what he’s done that is related to parenting, not even touching on all of the abuse and manipulation he put me through. I’m done being silent.

I am so burnt out and exhausted that I actually regret having my child despite loving her. I hate her father for treating us both so terribly and putting us in this position. I just want to run away.

He is currently in speech, OT, behavioral therapy, and we will be having an ABA therapist coming in June to work with him on potty training. Navigating all these therapies and what not has been exhausting in and of itself, let alone the regular bullshit that comes with parenthood and everyday life. 

The 5 year old needs CONSTANT entertainment and can never just play on her own. She’s loud, emotional, dramatic, and she’s just a lot. We probably allow her too much screen time just so we can have a minute to breathe without her demanding something or driving us nuts.

Aside from the autism, the 3 year old is just at a terrible age. He screams NOOOOO at us no matter what we ask him to do. Lots of tantrums, and he is just completely unhinged. His new favorite pastime is to strip naked and run around the house. We often put him in his room for “quiet time” even if he doesn’t nap, which is usually his favorite time to 💩 since he has some privacy. Today, he took his clothes and his pull up off and proceeded to throw turds all over his carpet. So that was fun to clean up. 

My daughter was 9 months old when the pandemic started and I was going through terrible anxiety/mental health for the first 2+ years of her life. My pregnancy with my son was emotional hell because my daughter was getting sick from daycare every 3 seconds and I was extremely uncomfortable and miserable. I finally got on meds after I had him, which have helped somewhat, but I seriously enjoy very little about this phase of my life. It’s just non-stop. 

I feel like I have no business being a parent. I handle all of the mental load, like making sure my daughter’s school stuff is in check, lunch is packed, the right sized clothes are in their closets, managing schedules, appointments, meal planning, etc… but I’m not the fun one. I’m not nurturing, and I don’t enjoy playing pretend.  I have absolutely no patience and am always on edge and overstimulated. I have constant guilt because of the way I am. My husband is the one who gets on the floor and plays, is the patient one, the fun one, the one who was meant for this parenthood thing. I miss the relationship we used to have beyond a date night every now and then. He gets frustrated that we don’t have much of a physical relationship these days, but I am always so exhausted and overwhelmed that sex is the furthest thing from my mind. It’s hard to have passion for each other when your life revolves around the kids.

I got pregnant at 20 by a guy I was dating when I found out I told him and my bestie at the time, told them to keep it quiet because I wasn't sure what i wanted to do. I knew i didn't want to have kids yet so i was going between abortion or adoption. My BD told my parents and i was unaware. One night they invited me over for dinner when I arrived my whole immediate family was standing around the table. My parents, grandparents, my brothers, my punk ass step mom, my uncle with his wife and my sister in law....We don't typically get together like that unless it's a holiday I was very confused and scared of what could be wrong. Come to find out it was an intervention for ME!!! They talked about how we don't abort babies in this family or give them away, if I didn't want the child my step mom who I HATE always have (it's a long story) would adopt him or the family would simply step in in a major way to help me raise him....I was raised in the church so they threw that one at me too...I allowed them to convice me to keep a child I never intended to keep and I regret it almost everyday. I would have never let my step mom adopt him and I could have lived the life I wanted. Instead I'm broke every week unable to afford groceries or go to the laundry mat regularly and the help they offered seems more like they want something to hold over my head. I should feel bad they have to help me raise him when this is never what I wanted to begin with. The BD who told on me isn't even in the picture like he should be, he doesn't contribute at all not even with seeing him but still tries to get back with me even after all these years after telling him no a thousand times. He's only a good dad if he can date me other than that he could careless...so why did you even tell on me?? Why make me have a child you didn't want either it was all a trick to keep me around and I hate everyone that was involved in convincing me to have this child...Now I'm basically raising my BD because my son is just like him horrible attitude with a bad anger problem, ADHD, and bad eyesight...my BD was adopted by the way...him and his sister together as babies and he loves his mom...

It's been 12 years and I'm still angry. Being a mother is depressing, unrewarding, nothing I ever aspired to be apart of. I always wanted to be like my auntie, she never had kids before she passed but she was the most at happy and at peace woman I ever meet.

I did a two hour lesson on Wednesday, and my husband suggested we practice today after he comes home from work, which we did and came back just now.

I honestly did fairly well on Wednesday despite it being my first lesson and never having driven on main roads. But today I drove so much worse with kids at the back, so loud. 

At the end of the practice, I needed to turn left, but because it took me a little while and got beeped at.

If I didn't have them at the back, I would have been able to focus on driving a lot better. I know I need to practise outside of lessons, but I'm feeling so much worse and I honestly regret doing it.

I'm neither from the US or live in the US.
My home country has a very reliable public transport, hence I never ""needed"" to learn when I was younger. I worked part time while in uni, but spent all the money on studying abroad instead. I live in a different country now and I've only done two hours worth of lessons so far, saying it's my ""skill issue"" is laughable. Of course I'm not a skilled driver. Where did I claim that?

03 May 2025,I wish daycare was longer,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kdjnoi/i_wish_daycare_was_longer/,"I quit my job and start my new job next week. I quit my job without a traditional 2 weeks notice because they treated me like garbage and I honestly didn’t want to work straight for 2 weeks and start my new job immediately. So I decided to enjoy my 2 week break but that didn’t end up happening.. 

My on boarding was on Monday and I spent all of my morning at onboarding and I kid you not… on my way home the daycare calls telling me that my son has a high fever and to come pick him up. We tried sending him back to daycare the other day but my toddler threw up in my husbands car on the way to daycare so he turned back around home and when I heard my kid back home in the morning while I was in bed, I was like “oh no not again.” 

My toddler (2 years old) has been sick all week. On and off fever and diarrhea. Luckily he’s been feeling better so I’m really hoping he won’t miss any daycare time this week.

This was suppose to be my day off for the 2 weeks but this entire week I wasted my break taking care of my toddler all day. On top of that we moved apartments the other day so it’s been a lot of moving, packing, unpacking. I spent my break taking care of a cranky sick toddler and moving.

I really thought I would be able to enjoy some of this break. I knew we were going to be moving but I didn’t expect my kid to get sick and miss daycare an entire week. It was just another thing to worry about. This week has been miserable. It’s been full of nonstop crying, screaming, clingyness and tantrums… so many tantrums.

I wish daycare was longer. I know I can’t ever say that in real life out loud but truly it’s not enough time to ourselves. We literally all work 8 hours all day and then immediately have to take care of the kids. I do get help but it’s still so much to handle. 

My daycare already has good hours. They are open from 7:30AM-5:30PM. But the thing is I work those hours so it’s just not fair. I wish daycare was until 8PM. I truly will never understand the other moms on the other subs talking about how they wish they didn’t work so they can spend every minute of the day with their kids or how sad they are leaving their kid at daycare and going to work. I’ll never understand the “mom guilt.” I can’t relate to most moms. I find them annoying and preppy, personality wise as well.

I feel like I should feel bad for saying all this which is why I’d never say this in real life since it’s so stigmatized to have these emotions as a woman and a mother but it’s just the truth. I’d be looked at like a crazy person for saying all this out loud. 

I’m tired. I hate being a mom. I hate working. I hate this life. We all literally just work a 8 hour job everyday just to immediately come home and take care of the kids, cook, clean, and sleep the rest of the 8 hours to start the same shitty day all over again. I want more time to myself. Not just for one whole day or one weekend, I just want it to be us before the baby. It was just simpler and easier and less exhausting.",Likely mother: 4 > 0

So I grab the teeth brushing stuff and now shes mad I grabbed it because she wanted to grab it. So I put it back down but I didn't put it exactly where it was so she chucks it at the mirror. (All while screaming bloody murder). So I grab the stuff and shove it in a cabinet she cant reach because I am not cool with throwing things at mirrors. Then she just keeps screaming because she cant reach it. So then after she calms down a bit I grab it for her then she wont brush her teeth. Back to the beginning of this charade of brushing teeth. Normally I just hold her down and do it but I was just not in the mood for that tonight. Sometimes I can feel my anger rising to dangerous levels and Im scared if I hold her down to brush her teeth when Im that mad I wont be nice about it. Im just so tired of the battles over everything.

I had a dog who was my adorable sidekick. I spoke multiple languages fluently, had many diverse interests and hobbies, traveled multiple times a year, and always had a packed social schedule. 

Pregnancy was fraught with complications and I had to stop all my physical activities. I was constantly drained and slept. Depression set in. All my coping were thrown out the window. I found out I was having a girl and I never wanted one. I wasn't exactly sold on having kids but having a girl was a fear because of my own mother's abuse tainting the idea of a mother-daughter relationship. 

A few weeks after the baby was born, all texts checking in stopped. People soft offered to visit to help or even drop off a meal and all of that was fake. Only one friend dropped off one meal. People only asked about the baby. Not me. And then the texts/offers completely stopped. I guess sharing that the baby was not well/sick was a mistake and I should have put on a fake face and lied about how motherhood is so perfect and how the baby is so cute. 

The baby started having feeding issues (actual diagnosed medical issues) and not gaining weight. She's small for her age and still feeds every 2 hours. Because of her medical issues, every 2 hour block is spent feeding her or consoling her, and there's maybe a 15 min cat nap in there. She doesn't sleep. She screams, she fusses, and it's an endless nightmare. 

My poor dog is starved for attention and love, which I cannot give to her because my hands are constantly busy. I'm lucky if I can poop in peace. Sometimes I poop with the baby in my hands because she's inconsolable and her cries bring on vomiting spells that projectile all over the carpet, her clothes, my clothes. All my time is spent keeping her fed and calm. Calmness may be only a few minutes per day. The rest of her day is spent screaming, vomiting. All advice about swaddles, swaying, shushing, calm music, etc does not work on her. She's like a little demon. She's the incarnation of the curse my own mother gave to me - that I will have a daughter and she will make my life a living hell. 

Living hell is an understatement. This was a huge mistake. 

I want to die. I just dream about falling asleep because I am so sleep deprived, but then I also dream about never waking back up. Yes, I'm in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. 

No, I don't have the means to ""fix this"" or get some respite. The baby is in medical treatment and under constant medical supervision due to her slow growth. I don't have the money to hire a baby sitter because the baby's medical costs are exorbitant. I get help maybe once a week, if that, for a few hours, from a well-meaning family member who will come over, make a mess in the house as they ""help"" and then get to leave this hellhole, where I am left alone with the screams. The baby's father tries to help after work, but our relationship is now ruined. All we do is talk about the baby's medical issues and we don't have time for ourselves.

There were aunts and family members that we’re supposedly taking custody of her, but nothing fell through. Honestly, they didn’t want to. They would call and give my daughter a sob story but the social worker told me that they never returned her calls or filled out the paperwork that was sent to them. 

We’re here now, and things can be fine for a bit but she’s so adversarial with me. Everything turns into an argument. It doesn’t matter how I say things, she ends up yelling, rolling her eyes, being rude, and completely disregards anything I tell her. The biggest issue is the way she dresses and how boy obsessed she is. And I get it, we all want attention, but it’s just not appropriate. I had to contact the police when she was in high school because of older men contacting her on social media, and she was making plans with them to meet up. It’s been a struggle. 

My husband and I have tried to build some sense of community for her with us and our family. But, it’s obviously not enough to give her a sense of security. And I’m empathetic to what she’s gone through. I know we’re not going to fix anything and all we can do is be supportive. But it’s hard to keep trying when she constantly pushes back and is rude and disrespectful towards me. Everything is just a fight. Every day.

29 April 2025,Quit Comparing Easy Babies/kids to Difficult Babies/kids,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1kac3wk/quit_comparing_easy_babieskids_to_difficult/,"Some people in this world are fucking lucky to have an easy baby or kids and it feels like a complete slap in the face when people who have easy to normal kids want to give you advice or make assumptions. Why is it always the parents who have easy to normal kids that put in their input EVERYWHERE always stating the problem is YOU...

So some context here, my husband has this friend, 22f, that has a toddler and now pregnant with her second child. My husband has confided in her about how I regret having our son (who's now 3mo) and that I truly despise motherhood. She asked what I don't like about it and his answer in short was ""Everything, that I feel like I have to give up everything to be a mom."" Her response was that I don't have to give up the things I like to be a mom. And proceeded to go on and on about how when her first baby was born and our sons age she continued going on hikes, camping, going out etc all while her infant came with. That it's just about perspective... She went on to say that if I love going on hikes with my dogs and being in nature, it's as simple as just going out and doing that stuff, just put the baby in a baby carrier and go on your way!

My son has colic. He sleeps for maybe 30 minutes AT MOST... will stay awake for hours grunting, groaning, moaning, screaming, crying, and any fucking noise under the sun he could make.... It's fucking ANNOYING and over stimulating. Even just to take him on a walk in the stroller around the block, he screams and cries the entire time... I feel like I'm a fucking walking condom advertisement and it's embarrassing. I also have degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia, and hEDS that I struggle with on the daily so carrying him for miles strapped onto me in the woods would literally be the death of me.

She continued to encourage that my husband should get me to do those things with him for bonding. Like sorry, if I'm going out into the woods to hike with my dogs, it's for peace and quiet. To recharge my introvert self... not to struggle carrying extra weight and listening to crying.... I was immediately thrown onto the PPD train of course as well. My husband also told her how I don't want anymore kids and she told him to ""just give me time"" and to focus on bonding... A bunch of other ""great advice"" was given that I could go on and on about.... Worst part is, him and her talk every day and it's begun to give me anxiety about if they're talking about me.

Ultimately, I'm just fucking pissed off, tired, and don't have the energy to talk to my husband about how his choice to confide in her made me feel. Honestly even if I had the energy, could I even get out more than a sentence before our son starts screaming and crying and has to be tended to...

Honestly every single day I question if this marriage and family is what I want. The constant judgement, the constant ""advice"", the isolation even though there is so...much...noise... I just can't fucking do this anymore.",Likely mother: 9 > 0

It's from the regret of starting a family and the hatred of parenthood. The irreversible decision to bring a baby into this world. No amount of therapy and meds is ever going to make me feel better about it. I have no choice but to accept that my life is forever changed with more responsibility, hardships and financial strain. 

(yes I love my son but I hate being a mother). And before anyone says ""you should have kept your legs closed"" or ""what did you expect"", I made a mistake.....a big one. No I didn't think it'd be easy but I  also wasn't expecting to feel this way.",Likely mother: 4 > 0
28 April 2025,I think I'm a horrible mother,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ka1yug/i_think_im_a_horrible_mother/,"I really never wanted kids because frankly it scared the crap out of me. Well, I got married, accidently got pregnant, but ended up losing the baby at 17 weeks due to trisomy 18. Absolutely broke my heart because after I got pregnant, I realized I actually wanted that baby.

Fast forward 4 years and we do IVF and get lucky the first time and end up with a healthy baby boy. He is now almost 4 and it has been tough. He has ADHD and a sensory disorder. On top of that, my husband and I are in the middle of a separation because he lies and has alcohol issues and I have caught him on dating sites. We live together because we absolutely can't afford to live separately and have no family we can move in with. 

It has been really hard. My husband and I get into screaming matches sometimes and I have so much anger towards him. I get so frustrated and feel so alone and end up yelling at my son too. He is very defiant and doesn't listen because of his issues and it is very, very hard. 

This morning my husband told me that our son got mad at him yesterday and told him he was going to kick him out of the house because he was a liar, a cheater and a meanie.  Ugh. Not sure if my husband is telling the truth, well because he is known to lie but I feel absolutely horrible. I asked my son this morning if he got mad at Dad yesterday and what he said. My son told me he called him a bootie head because he was being mean so who knows. But I still feel like a failure. IF my son did in fact call my husband a liar and a cheater, it is because he overheard us arguing. And that is my fault and soooo wrong in so many levels. I'm sick. I failed as a mother. I wasn't built to handle a child. I told my son that he hurt Dad's feelings and to please not talk to him that way. That I wasn't mad at him but that it wasn't right and not to do it again.

My parents fought constantly growing up and would talk so bad about each other to my brother, sister and I. They are still married but unhappily. And they think that is some kind of accomplishment. That I should tough it out and remain married for my son's sake. I disagree. I want different for him. I want him to see his Dad and I both happy eventually.

But I still F'd up and bad. I'm so scared I screwed up my son. I start therapy in a couple days and my husband does too. I got to do better and I know that but so scared I already did so much damage to my son. Can I fix this??? 

Update: Well things have progressed and gotten really bad. Everytime my husband tell my son to do something like go potty or brush your teeth, ect. my son gets mad and tells him he needs to go live somewhere else or he is going to kick him out. My husband lost it this morning because it happened again while getting him ready for school and a screaming match started up and he accused me of talking shit about him to my son. Which I do not do btw. I wouldn't do that. It is all from the argument he overheard. My husband is on a rampage now saying I'm out to get him and ruin him and take his son away, ect.",Likely mother: 13 > 1

Yesterday was a particularly testing day with us both recovering from a viral infection and my partner starting to show symptoms. So I thought ""hey, I'm going to pop an earphone in and listen to some of my favourite tunes and podcasts to try and take the edge off of the CONSTANT neediness / dragging me around / pointing at fruits on bloody YouTube and expecting me to say what they are). And I can honestly say that it helped take the edge off a little. By no means has it transformed parenting for me, but it splits my attention just enough that I don't constantly feel on the edge of screaming at him to leave me alone for 5 goddamn minutes.

27 April 2025,I despise my son,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1k8s8mn/i_despise_my_son/,"He has the worst attitude. He's rude and disrespectful whenever he doesn't get what he wants. Example: tonight he wanted to watch something on the iPad. Okay, no big deal, at least it shouldn't be a big deal. Then when it comes time to turn it off, he asks to play video games. No, it's bed time. Then comes the meltdown, during the course of which he claims he never wanted to watch anything on the iPad, he hated what he was watching (for a whole fucking hour), and that he said ""a hundred"" times that he asked us to play video games instead. It's like he's either convinced we're stupid enough that such bald faced lies are going to work on us, or he's just straight up detached from reality. Like he's so addicted to screens that withdrawal causes a straight up psychotic break.

Anyways, I spent a half an hour in his room with him, getting screamed at, punched, kicked, books thrown at me. I lift my hand to block a kick from him and it causes his leg to bounce back at him and he basically knees himself in the jaw. Then my wife gets involved and he tells her that I punched him in the face. That I threatened to sell his stuff (which was some wild extrapolation that HE made while he was screaming at me). All sorts of shit.

I'm so sick of the grunting and groaning and whining and moaning.

It wasn't always this bad. It was pretty bad a long while before but I thought he had turned a corner. Instead he's regressed.

I can hear him outside with his mom right now telling her he gets to listen to an audio book. Telling her. He seriously thinks he's in charge. He's trying to boss her around and tell her what to do. He was doing the same thing to me earlier.

When I was his age, I had a healthy fear of my parents. They could take things away. They could send us to our rooms. They could punish us. Fuck, my parents spanked me. But this kid is in such deep denial about the way things work. If I tell him he doesn't get video games for the rest of the weekend because of his behavior, he just goes on and on: ""yes, I do. It's my decision not yours. I can have as much as I want.""

So there's no reasoning with him. Threats don't work.

And this is just a tantrum. His behavior when he's not having one isn't much better.

Every other word out of his mouth is ""sus."" And he cannot not talk. He always has to be saying something. Commenting on what's on TV. Responding to the TV with irreverent, vulgar bullshit. Constant streams of what I guess an eight year old thinks is good pitches for a sketch comedy show. Sup bro. Incessant hypotheticals about what if such and such happened wouldn't it be funny? I can't handle the constant stream of noise, the incessant demand for attention, especially the fact that they're all so cringey.

And I haven't even touched on how he treats his little brother. Walking into him, pushing him, punching him. This isn't typical big brother shit either. He's a straight up bully. He told me that because his little brother annoys him that gives him the right to punch him in the face.

Unsurprisingly, though, he can't take what he dishes out. If his little brother ever gets a hit in on him, he fucking crumples up, shrieking and whining and putting on this great big show of how hurt he is

Honestly, I just really don't like who he's becoming. i can see him being the kind of guy that peaks in high school and never realizes that what works for him then doesn't anymore until it's too late.",Likely father: 2 > 0

So many times I thought I was ""feeling better"" and could leave this group behind me. Especially lately. I felt love and amazement peeking through most of my days. 

Then yesterday happened.

I took my son shopping. He has always loved shopping & has never given me a hard time in a store. But, it was a big shop, we needed a lot of stuff for his party tomorrow. By the time we made it to the check out line he was crying. By the time we were leaving the check out line he was HISTERICAL. I was crying. I was angry. I was **EMBARASSED**. 

A nice older lady helped me bag my stuff, then walked me to the car and put my bags in my car while I put the baby in the car seat. He was fine the second we stepped outside. I was sobbing.

The lady hugged me and left. She was an angel.

I came home & my husband took the baby. I still couldn't stop crying. I was in awe of how many people, even kids, showed compassion. Yet, my pride was destroyed ( I REALLY struggle asking for or receiving help). As the day went on I realized more & more that a lot of what happened was my fault. I was unprepared. 

I feel like months of emotional progress in the right direction was changed within minutes.

I'm still shaken up today. Most of my thoughts are negative - ""I never wanted to be a parent"" , ""Why did I do this?"", ""Will he know he wasn't wanted? How good can I fake this & for how long?"" & Suicidal ideations (yes I see a therapist & psychiatrist for PPD). 

On top of it it we have to celebrate his birthday tomorrow where everyone will tell me how cute he is and how blessed I am and all that dumb shit people say to be nice in leiu of being realistic. 

I just needed to vent. I can't get out of this dark headspace. I'm so physically & emotional exhausted & touched out.

My husband's working & told me to call my MIL for help today. This isn't something a few ""hours to myself"" to do laundry & dishes & whatever the fuck else can fix. 

I want to rewind time. I want to run away. Sometimes I want to die. 

But my childhood was super fucked up & I want to do my best to give my kid support & a good life. I feel so dramatic for responding like this to a single temper tantrum. If we were home I would have handled it fine. But dealing with that in public was mortifying & I can't shake it.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

I hate being stuck in one place with no freedom to change what I'd want, when I'd want. I wouldn't say my life was great before but at least I was able to just get on a train and go somewhere new to get this dopamine hit that my brain needs so much. 
And yet, one day I was like: ""yeah, let's see what happens if we won't protect ourselves"". 10 months later- I'm stuck. Exactly the way I was afraid I'd be one day. My worst nightmare is happening because of my own stupidity (but I mostly blame hormones for making me make this decision lol). I really hope that in few months/years/whenever my baby is old enough to be my adventure buddy I'll be happy I have her, but for now it's hard to think that, cause it's never easy with kids. I won't have this freedom ever again, to go somewhere, to walk on a tiny bit dangerous path just to have a beer with a beautiful view, without million people around. Or at least not until she'd grow up. But then I'll be old and tired (pls don't tell me that I just need to take care of myself and I'll be good). 
And to top it all up- I have a mother in law from hell who literally messed up my whole pregnancy experience, and not only that- she messed up my whole relationship with the baby's father already before I got pregnant.

Don't get me wrong theres highs and lows, newborn phase is hard so its probably one of the lows. But parenting as a gig in general is really boring an unfulfilling.

I mean people will say its worth it to see the smile on your childs face but do we really feel that or are we pretending?

My kids are 8 and 3.5 and I still have to wait until bedtime or when my husband is available to take a freaking shower. My own needs are almost never met, and certainly not in a timely manner.

My kids fight constantly and my neurodivergent eldest is high support needs. Everything is a battle with her — brushing teeth, eating, showering, literally everything. They both need constant managing and neither plays well independently. My eldest stays up until 9 pm now so I’m basically off duty from parenting long enough to shower and sleep (9-6 am). I am a massive introvert but I’m living a life that requires me to be constantly “on”. My kids get a mostly patient and cheerful mom but inside I’m dying. 

It’s like groundhog day where all I do is chores and feed kids and break up arguments. Rinse and repeat. I have hobbies I’d love to be doing (gardening! crafting! home improvement!) but I can’t. I have close friends and try to get out of the house but it’s not often enough to counterbalance the daily grind. I’m miserable and I’m a shell of the person and parent I once was.

I literally don’t even know what to do anymore to improve things. We’re already doing all the things. Medication, therapy, parenting courses, reading parenting books, positive reward systems, timers, visual charts. All the professionals tell us we’re handling things well — sometimes I wonder if it’s because our kids are so well supported that I’m so incredibly burnt out. We have no extended family support.

My youngest is finally in school two days a week, so, in theory, I have 16 hours a week to myself which is an immense relief when it happens. But my eldest has been on Easter break since the beginning of April so I have had one child or another with me since then. My husband and I sometimes swap weekends away, but the way the kids fight lately has made that really difficult. For safety we often need to separate them. We regularly have to each take a child to do an activity in a different part of the house. Otherwise it ends in screaming/tears/meltdowns that can take hours to regulate.

I’m in severe chronic parenting burnout with no real relief. Honestly so is my husband. All the happiness has been sucked out of parenting and what was once my greatest joy now feels like a prison of my own making.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

I’m turning 22 here shortly and I just started a good paying job. After doing the calculations (budgeting lol) and whatnot, seems like everything will be fine financially! I’m super happy about that, so I’m thinking I can do a little something for myself this time. I haven’t celebrated my birthday in the past 4 years. Becoming a mom right after I turned 20 and living with someone who doesn’t celebrate holidays/birthdays of any kind, it’s been a bit…lonely? I have friends and family, but I think splurging on myself will do me much good. I’m kind of burnt out on spending money on diapers and baby food 😅 

Only problem is that I’m scared to spend. Even though I can, I feel like something is just going to pop up where I’ll regret just doing anything. I constantly think my son needs something else, even though he has what he needs. I’m exhausting. I just want to be told that I can do this and not feel bad for going out for a couple of hours. It’s hard enough to do anything for myself without thinking I’m excluding my son, it feels selfish. Is this normal? How can I make myself feel better about…myself?

The screaming and crying gets me so overstimulated. On top of that I have a cat (who I also love dearly,) that's always getting into shit he's not supposed to at the worstpossibletimes. I can't stand the constant dishes, laundry and mess. The constant cleaning with screaming in the background is sending me into orbit. I'm tired of all the broken sleep and never feeling fully rested. My hair is falling out and I never managed to lose all my ""baby weight"". None of my old clothes fit me, and if it does, it doesn't fit right. (I don't want to buy a whole new wardrobe).  I feel ugly as fuck and I'm constantly stressed out now. 

Fuck the village that i have. They never respect my boundaries when it comes to my rules and parenting. They don't listen to me and refuse to follow directions. Anytime I have someone watch my son it's like I have to micromanage them so it's not really a break for me. As soon as my son starts crying, they always think it's because he's hungry then they end up over feeding him and I have to deal with the upset stomach/spitup/vomiting/gas afterwards. 

Again, I love my son but I'm fucking tired. I wouldn't have all these problems and stress if I never had him.

My wife used to be an incredible person.  We didn't want kids.  We agreed on this.  Well, several years into our wonderful marriage, she changed her mind and suddenly wanted kids.  I reluctantly, stupidly agreed after much coercion.  Well, we had a kid.  It has been complete and utter hell.  He is now 6 years old and in school.  We get calls from the school all the time for his behaviour.  He is oppositional defiant, autistic, and generally an enormous asshole of a human being.  The experts in the field of children are continually defeated.  We've been to them all.  There hasn't been a ""child whisperer"" that he hasn't absolutely destroyed.  We've been referred to so many specialists.  The honest few tell us that they can't help us and to get hobbies.  The rest just keep referring us so they don't have to see him anymore.  Luckily we are in a public school that can't easily kick him out.  So at least he goes somewhere for a few hours during the day.  But then we have him all night and every weekend.  I never thought I'd hate weekends.  I do now because we are stuck with this damn kid all day when there's no school.  Well, throughout all of this, my lovely wife just keeps being 100% infatuated with this kid.  She loves him so much and he can do no wrong in her eyes.  Unfortunately all of her love and energy go into the kid.  So there isn't much leftover for anyone else.  I completely support her financially, emotionally, and every other way.  She is an educated experienced badass in the professional world, but she wanted to be a stay at home mom to her precious angel.  So I'm on the hook for everything.  She can't blame him for his behaviour so she blames and yells at me every single day.  I have fantasies about running away from my life.  It is about time to turn fantasy into reality.

Am I the only one?  Has anyone else run out on a perfectly good spouse because the fucking kid(s) ruined it?

22 April 2025,I don’t like doing mom things,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1k5huyr/i_dont_like_doing_mom_things/,"I have a 2 year old and they have so many events at his daycare. Most recently the Easter hunt and I took my pto just to relax at home and my husband suggested I go to his Easter hunt since parents are invited I said no. I don’t wanna spend my day off doing that. Even if I did that, my toddler would just cry and try to come home with me and not even participate in the Easter hunt if he saw that I came so that would just be pointless for me and him. It took my kid 2 months to even stop crying every time we dropped him off at daycare. Anyways I was called selfish because I didn’t wanna go to a stupid Easter hunt. I don’t even like Easter, it’s a stupid holiday

I don’t like going to kid events. All the moms around me love that shit. They volunteer at schools/daycares and I personally won’t be ever doing that with my free time. I hardly get any free time as it is so I’ll be damned if I get judged by everyone else because I don’t want to use the very little free time I have to volunteer doing a bunch of shit I don’t like to do 

I pick up my kid from daycare right after I’m done with work and I’m just in and out. But I see the other moms genuinely happy when they pick up their kids and talking to them in a baby voice and everything while I just pick him up and put him straight to the car so we can go home

Other moms are just nonstop talking about their kids and spending time with them posting so many pics of them on social media while I don’t. I personally don’t post pics of my kid cuz I don’t know everyone who follows me that well on IG and it’s like what if you’re a pedo? Then his SIL tells my husband that she can tell I have PPD cuz I don’t post my kid but for some reason I post my dog. Like what? I’ve been accused of PPD because I don’t post pics of my son on social media but no I don’t have PPD (anymore) I had that when I was around 6 months PPD but no not anymore I just don’t like being a mom. I don’t have that same bubbly and maternal instincts that every other woman has. It’s not my personality and that’s never been my personality and I’m not gonna pretend to be something I’m not 

I definitely relate more to the stereotype dad than the stereotype mom

My husband is always talking about how other moms and other women love being a mom and love kids and love doing mom shit but then there’s me 

I don’t like cooking, I don’t like baking, I’m not into being a trad wife with a bunch of kids. I’m not baking you bread from scratch. I’m not spending my entire day volunteering at a school. No I wouldn’t mind being a house**wife**, but I don’t want to be a stay at home mom again. I literally got a job so I can spend time away from my kid. Now I don’t know if it’ll get better and maybe this toddler stage is too much. Sometimes I feel like it’ll get better once my son is more independent, talking, out of diapers but then again I can’t predict the future but I do know for a fact that I’m never gonna be the Betty Crocker or a PTA mom",Likely mother: 12 > 0
22 April 2025,Just waiting to die,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1k5b91x/just_waiting_to_die/,"Hello all. Been reading this sub for a time now and it has helped me to know that I'm not the only one with these feelings. I'm a father(M34) of two. I have one daughter of 2.5 years old and a son 9 months old. Sad to say but I realized too late that I'm not made for this. 

When my daughter was born I was in somewhat good place in my life, but the whole 9 months of waiting I had my doubts about being a father. I divorced when my daugter was 6 months old. And now I have this son with another woman. All I can tell is I feel somekind of hatred towards my son. It's not his fault that he was born to this world but rather mine. I feel connection towards my daughter but I can't help my feelings towards my son. He wasn't planned and maybe that's why I feel that he has ""ruined my life"". Of course I understand that it was me who put this whole shitstorm going in the first place so I can only look at the mirror. And that I do, every single day I regret my decisions, trying not to put my anger and resentment to my children. 

I dont bond with my 9 month old son at all. I feel like I just hate him and maybe that is the main reason for that. All he does with me is cry and scream. He refuses to eat while with me or when I'm trying to feed him. I just dont feel that he's my son at all. I don't even want to hold him because I feel so bad father and disconnected. I never wanted to be like this but what the hell here I am spiraling to doom. It's funny because I feel deep love and empathy towards my daughter, but I just can't find that same feeling with my son. And I've been trying to search my mind for the answer yet haven't found one. Probably some deep insecurities or some issues related to the relationship with my own father but as far as I remember my dad was very caring and supportive when I was a child. 

Right now I'm just waiting to die. I go to sleep so frustrated and deprived and I wish I would not wake up anymore. I keep telling myself ""maybe 20 more years and it'll be all over"". Been thinking about kms lately as well. I regret not having some ""me time"" when I divorced. I planned to but I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, jumping to baby bubble straight away AGAIN like it would solve anything. I've lost all my inspiration to do anything. I used to work out and be healthy. I got interested in new stuff but right now I'm just rotting at my couch, doing my share of household chores and waiting for bedtime. Work is my safe place where I don't have to think about my children or talk about anything related to children. 

I don't know what the fuck to do. I feel like such a horrible person. And I keep telling myself that everyday. I feel like I failed big time. I thought I wanted this but oh how wrong I was and now it's too late to turn back. Thank god I have psychiatrist appointment in 2 weeks so I can vent.",Likely father: 4 > 0

I am so increadibly sad and feeling the trauma of the past years. I spent Easter with another family, they have 3 adorable children. They are realising zhey dream home now. Everyday was about happy things, wanting something and then just doing it. It was such a relaxing atmosphere there. It crushed me, this is how I envisioned my life with kids. Instead I have to children with extra needs, one is on the spectrum and the other chronically ill. Our family lives in ongoing stress, sickness, hospital stays, fights, overall my husband and I are hitting burnout. It has been almost 6 years now. Never a break. There is no progress in our personal life, we just manage the stress day by day. I already know that our family life isn't normal, but really seeing what normal means - oh boy. It looked like a walk in the parc. Yeah I know they still find it hard sometimes. But they clearly do not carry the weight of beeing the caretaker of sick children. We do not live in the same universe. And the grief of that is immense. When we came back, i just wanted to cry for hours. Cry because i didn't want to go back to my life, and cry because I had to see this happiness without ever beeing able to participate on it.

For me Easter Sunday came not only at the end of a move that was facilitated within 24 hrs (back story Mother’s Day weekend 2024 a tree went through the roof of the townhome we rent and they finally moved us and gave us a week to do so) and my best friend and her partner got married. 

The day was spent helping get the bride ready, husband officiated the wedding and I asked my teens in advance if they would help wrangle her kiddos (she and her wife have 3 kids between 8-10 which my twins baby sit for her frequently). At the end of the day we set up an Easter egg hunt for the young ones and then left to go home. 
Queue the guilt trip- so we are just never going to do that anymore? What? Egg hunts or Easter baskets? Now I haven’t done the Easter egg hunt thing for almost 3 yrs my twins are a few months shy of 15 I do however normally give them some kind of goody bag with a ridiculous amount of chocolate/candy but with the move it was more just hey I stopped at 5 below here’s some Easter candy rather than a put together basket. When I mentioned this the response I got was you know we are still kids… this from the child who I just caught sexting a random boy. 
I just want to bang my head against a wall I’m so burnt out. My husband is officially not working and on disability so any income I have HAS to go to necessities first and foremost (I make too much for any assistance).

Not everyone knows how to be a mom.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1k4bybf/its_ok_not_everyone_knows_how_to_be_a_mom/,"This is what another mom told me yesterday at a small Easter egg hunt gathering we had on my street. This lady is actually my neighbor, but I've never officially met her until yesterday. My other neighbor who also has kids invited our toddler to do an Easter egg hunt on our street, and I really didn't want to participate and didn't want us to go at all. First, my son is only 2 years old. Their kids are much older than my son (like they're all at least 5 years old and go all the way up to preteen years). Second, I actually don't like socializing with other moms because I find them to be weird. They either make weird comments like what this lady said to me, or they start to compare their kids' milestones, which is a huge turnoff for me. I made the mistake of telling these 2 moms my woes of potty training my kid because he seriously refuses to use the toilet, and we've been at this for about a year. And then out of nowhere, one of the moms said, ""It's OK. Not everyone knows how to be a mom."" And of course, their kids are perfect and learned how to fully use the toilet in less than a week.

I completely stopped talking to them at that point. They even sat together and away from me. Instead, the husband of the mom who said that started talking to me, and we bonded over our childhood because we found out we grew up on the same exact street and went to the same schools. I never ran into him because I'm older than him by a few years so we didn't run in the same circles. I'm starting to think his wife got jealous or something because her husband and I had so much in common?

Anyway, after that I told my husband that we are never joining them again if they invite us. I didn't even want to go in the first place, and my gut feeling was right. To be honest, I wonder too if she got jealous because I only have one kid and won't be having more. Even her husband said how much harder it is to have multiple kids, and he said he would've been happy with just their oldest son. I don't know but his wife's comment seemed completely out of line and now I have to wonder if she got jealous.",Likely mother: 2 > 0

Help me make my next move. What would yours be after reading the below? 
This last weekend I blacked out/ had a mini seizure- stress induced. Traumatic experience- I’m disoriented for weeks after these episodes. Haven’t had one in over 15mos, after finally going through doc and specialists, dmv reveal, yada yada. Stress induced according to docs. It’s so scary. I had them annually like clockwork once his pops began dragging me through family court, taking zero accountability and making my life hell under the guise of wanting to coparent. All he wants is control. How much time I’ve taken from work, how many thousands spent on lawyers, how much ptsd relived week after week? 
I also woke up next day to one of my mini hotdogs sick, uterus swollen, she needed emergency care and spay. 
We planned to have one litter for her for a few years back. never did , and I kept forgetting to spay. My fault. I had read of the risk. had to give her up that day at the vet. Heartbroken. Couldn’t afford the $8k minimum cost. I believe she’s made it, and is in a loving home.
My son is 14 now and a menace at home. 
Discovered he’s gotten into my safe recently, stole at least $1k if not more, and lied about it. Has been stealing for months, Keeps lying. Bought himself a ps5, hundreds in game cards, some new clothes, jewelry. 
Lost his phone last month that I pay for, broke his iPad, got a new oculus over summer that landed us back in court and is demanding I get him another phone so he can talk to his friends. Doesn’t want to ‘earn’ 
I had this kid at 22 by a predator, trafficker who SAd me. He’s sick. All over the internet with a track record good steer clear of. Made some poor choices, was too green to fully comprehend what I’d gotten myself into and got pregnant, got manipulated into keeping him, suffered 2 years of severe physical financial and emotional abuse till one day I decided to leave, with nothing but my 9 mo old in my car, drove cross country started over, in debt, alone, from scratch, for safety, stability. Dads in Fl and I went clear across the country back home. He left us be for some time, but I’d kept the line open to give him a chance at being a dad, allowed him to visit which was never for the kid it turns out. The one time he’d visited he brought a working girl here, stayed w me and demanded I give him $, etc etc. I kicked him out and years later he demanded I send kid to him at 8 years old, despite being MiA from his life. Send my son to a complete stranger across the country? Who’s continued to exhibit dangerous abuse towards women , had another kid, and had dragged her through court also, for control. Years of this. 
For me- Single parenting has been so challenging since covid, right round the time pops took me back to court for custody. 5 year court battle still going on- he’s not sincere, he’s trying to find a way to gain citizenship according to his other BMs, and it’s been horrific attacks in court, subpoenas, accusations, all for show. I have tried to protect my son from both that horrific abuse and his detrimental influence, to try and help my son avoid following dad’s footsteps. My son went from being a sweet boy, intriguing artistic, more or less good and motivated, excitable- to years of poor behavior, zero respect. I’ve essentially backed off, to avoid constant conflict- he fights, argues, demands, escalates, lies, and now is stealing from me. 
The freedom I understand isn’t the best move for kids in this age, stage, culture - and it’s only gotten worse. But it’s gotten there to avoid these episodes and this toxicity at home that just seems to lurk. I don’t understand his hate towards me. Refused to go to dad for the longest but is now wanting to all of a sudden, right after his lie to the therapist after me discovering the theft. Watched me break down from incessant court hearings, accusations by dad, and a barrage of attacks on top of seeing dads absolute lack of effort to even reach out and have a relationship, sees I want the best for him, yet his dad’s genes are becoming very prevalent in him. I’ve tried nearly everything to no avail aside from loving on him attention wise how I see he’s crying out for, lashing out because of- it’s very off putting. My upbringing is repulsed by it, although I’ve understood it and tired to navigate it, ive grown tired. he refuses to go to activities, sports, groups from church etc, skips school often, lies about it and his grades, I can never sit down and talk to him reasonably, interrupts, escalates, tells me to die and crash on my new motorcycle, get hit, yada yada. Daily. No chores are ever done, he games 24/7 and harasses me in between. Rarely took care of dogs, extreme care minimum at home to do anything. I understand he’s a teen and doesn’t have a male figure but he’s lashing out so much, it’s torn us apart. 
I have virtually no support system. I can tell ppl are sick of hearing of my plight- the friends who say they’re here for me, so I’ve been left to fend for myself. I understand. I got myself into this muck but in thinking I made the better choice, I’ve now suffered tremendously these past few years. I feel like I’m up against a losing battle. No one understands how it’s gotten this far with dad. Struggling to make it to work at home and help kid learn and mature and grow and have vision and perspective , I’ve become slow in some ways probably due to the constant ptsd with being b/w attacker pops and the outlandish behavior and environment my son has me in. I feel terrorised at home. I’m at my wits end. Problem is- if I send him to pops for good (because it’ll be for good)- we’ll play right into his hand and he’ll just take it further, taking me for child support cuz he’s a deadbeat, and probably trying to get me imprisoned for abuse. Just to stick it to me for ever leaving him and ever daring to try and protect Rubi, raise him right. The guy is a sad sad human. He’s suing me for $10 mil right now, for ever having a DV against him, suing my attorneys, her attorneys, AND NOW THE JUDGES, appeals every decision not in his absolute favor, and so much more. Ive always considered myself strong despite being meek - I’ve taken accountability, rarely ever victimized myself despite working for an agency that grants money specific to fighting crime against women and I am finally broken.

I posted my story quite a few times already, but in short, was on the 'no kids train', met great girl, she convinced me to do this life long mistake, it's been hell since the very beginning. 

I went to therapy and recently had some proper rest. Therapy helped me staying alive (strong feelings to unalive), but proper rest gave me time to really reflect and think about all that happened.

I used to be the 'nice guy', like did good just for honor and good will, felt good about myself on almost everything, life was great before them.  
  
But now every day I'm becoming the opposite of who I was, my morals, beliefs and even habits are changing, not only I'm becoming very apathetic, but also very egoistic.   
  
Like this last month great things happened, but knowing that I'm stuck with this burden for the rest of my life seems to just numbed me. 

E.g.: this week I was like the MVP in my job, like I was a great leader, the problem solver and the solution bringer, everyone praised and awarded me, some investments that I risky held gave some good returns, I slept somewhere else and could sleep long enough to dream. But none of that seems to have any effect.  
  
I can always hear their crying, and that takes a nice chunk of the day and night;  
I make good money, but most of it goes into the trash (special formulas, foods and diapers);  
I look into the mirror with disgust and I have no energy, discipline or will to do something about it (like healthy food, gym or whatever);  
I can see my partner becoming unhealthy, she's living almost 100% for the kids (I proposed some split on that burden with myself and/or babysitters, but she just doesn't accept \[maybe she's right about me, I probably would not make a good job\]).  
  
Honestly life is miserable, I'm trying some depression meds, but I don't think they'll work unless they take away the memory of this stupid 30M f\*ck saying yes to having kids and everything after.",Likely father: 3 > 0

For example, my relationship with my husband is slowly turning into a (loveless) pile of shit. Sleep deprivation is partly to blame on both ends, however I can't help but to resent how little his life has changed. Meanwhile my body has changed (disgusting amount of weight gain), hair loss and I had to put my career on hold. Were both so stressed from parenting that I can tell we're losing interest in eachother. Conversations are replaced with arguments and date nights have been replaced with alone time from one another. Our personalities have both changed since becoming parents and it's like we're both trying to figure out who we are again.

Id love even one weekend to have no plans, i always go back to work more tired than when the weekend began.  It’s a mental and physical tiredness.  Im constantly wishing them to be older so I can have my life back, I used to travel to sporting events, gigs and just doing stuff I wanted to do.

17 April 2025,If I knew then what I know now...,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1k15cvs/if_i_knew_then_what_i_know_now/,"Don't get me wrong - I would burn the world to the ground and roast s'mores over the ashes for my child. However, if I knew then what I know now, I would have chosen to stay childless. She will NEVER know that though.

Having a child was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. Pregnancy/L&D absolutely wrecked my body, exacerbating chronic illnesses (Fibro + Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) I didn't realize I had to the point of being bed/house bound 98% of the time. Every waking moment, I am in pain - sometimes minor, but other times debilitating. PPA/PPD hit me like a freight train from hell. Also, due to a tear during birth that got sewn up badly, I have a permanent hemorrhoid and even partially prolapse if the BM is bad enough.

I constantly think of the advice other parents have said about ""It is/will be worth it"", wondering when that feeling will begin. From the moment she was born, there was no ""love at first sight"" feeling. There WAS, however, the most insane, feral level protectiveness. I actually GROWLED at the nurse who was trying to get her AGAP scores. With my milk never coming in, I found it hard to bond with my baby, and the feeling of shame/inadequecy that I couldn't do the one big thing a mother is supposed to do still tears me up 9yrs later. 

Having a child also genuinely ruined my marriage because while my life was flipped upside down and inside out, my husband's changed very little. My child was so planned out, I know exactly when she was concieved, yet despite all the pre-planning for her (which was mutual), he never showed any excitement during my pregnancy. He and I didn't bond over the magic of me growing our child. My pregnancy felt very lonely a lot. Then there was the debacle that was my L&D. She decided at 3wks 6d before my due date that she didn't wanna come out, she just didn't want a waterbed. So, she had to be induced when contractions hadn't started almost 8hrs later. I was in labor for 23hrs 48min because the doctor told me that at 24hrs post-water breaking it would be a mandatory c-section. When she finally came, there was no emotion in his eyes as he held the child I had spent the last 9mo growing. While one of the nurses was stitching up my tear, he had the audacity to joke about getting the ""husband stitch""... If I hadn't been so preoccupied trying to breastfeed her, I would have clocked him.

After that, I was the one who had to do all the reasearch, learn all the things, make all the decisions. I never felt like I could trust him watching her alone - the few times there was ever any accident, it was because he wasn't paying nearly as close enough attention to her as he should have. And no matter how I tried to talk to him about it, he always just got defensive and nothing changed. Even now that she's older, I still worry. I also genuinely believe he doesn't really miss her when he's away from her, nor does he do a whole lot with her, just the two of them. He's always treated her like an inconvenient pet. It's just too much and it absolutely killed me on the inside. I'd look at other dads with their daughters spending time together, and it makes me weep that she doesn't have that, and there's only so much I can make up for.

Lastly, my child has thrown me curveballs in also every way possible - from coming a day short of 1 month early, to going through a ""HOW Phase"" (instead of a ""Why phase"" - yeah, think about all those questions you got asked, then switch out ""why"" with ""how""...). One of the big ones is having Oppositional Defiant Disorder. I was prepared for ADHD, but definitely not ODD! She's been in therapy every week for almost 3yrs, and yet there are still meltdowns like every other day. I have scoured the internet for tips/tricks/methodologies to help her, but nothing works for more than a few days. After big bedtime fights, I go to a quiet place by myself and break down. With as much of myself I have devoted solely to her, to hear ""I hate you"" or ""You're a bad mom"" crushes me every single time. I *know* you're not supposed to take anything they say to heart during a meltdown, but it's almost impossible not to. It then makes me wonder... did I give up my body/life/soul just to constantly fight with her? It's hard to feel any joy - of any kind, from anything - with this reality. 

I used to be an energetic, extroverted, adventurous, fully-abled person. Now I live every day in pain and deep fatigue, unable to do even a fraction of the things I used to love doing - especially seeing my friends - and I feel a little more dead inside with each day passing. I love my daughter more than anything or anyone in the whole world... but if I knew then what I know now...",Likely mother: 4 > 0
17 April 2025,I'm eroding away,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1k134xx/im_eroding_away/,"I don't know if I belong here but I didn't know where else to go. 

I just put away another box today, into the tomb of my basement closet. This one had my baking things in it. I haven't baked since my child was born. The box joined my other box of sewing, my other box of paints, my other box of gardening tools, my pottery tools, my books, my yoga gear, my scrapbooks, and the box of dog toys. Each box filled with something we don't use anymore because of my child's existence. 

I can't bring myself to throw them out. There's a pinch of hope that maybe one day I'll have the space (literally and figuratively) to go back to what used to bring me joy.

But this box was particularly difficult because it was the last one. All of my real hobbies are gone now, replaced by motherhood and chores. I love my child ... But I feel like I'm slowly eroding. Who I am...was ... no longer exists.

I wanted my child so much I went through IVF, but it took five years, and having a child at 35 is a lot harder than at 30. At 30 I was ready, I had open time to fill, a new husband to forge a new life with... And money to get us over any humps. Instead I spent five years trying to have a baby and forging a new me... Now I feel so inflexible and I wanted this... But it was supposed to be different. We were supposed to have close cousins and raise our children together... But a seven year old doesn't really play with a 2 year old. I don't know if I truly regret having my child, but I definitely regret what my life has become.

Since 2020, I have had primary custody of him. His father barely helping me at all during the beginning of our divorce. Finally in 2022, he started taking him for court order visitation (every Thursday and every other weekend). I still had my son the majority of the time. I handled ALL Dr appts, school related issues, etc.

Cue me being tired, burnt out, depressed, and stressed. I was never so regretful in my life. It stayed this way for 4 years. Dreading waking up every day. The dark cloud over my head coming home from work, knowing I was about to spend the next few hours being tortured by parenthood.

His dad finally got his life together and got a good job. His step mom also was able to get her self together and she helps with our son immensely. So they came to me and asked for 50/50. Not necessarily out of the goodness of their hearts, lol. But so I would take him off child support. I don't need his money. I need HELP. I told him that before.

So we're sharing my son now. One week on/one week off.

Awesome, that sounds amazing! Right? Then why am I crying? Why do I want to go get him? I actually asked to have him yesterday for a bit, and he'd only been gone 2 days. He missed me, so we had a wonderful evening together before I took him back to his dad. This is what I've always wanted (other than to go back in time and get back on the pill, lol). It's so weird to me that I wanted time away, and now that I have it, I'm sad.

Since the day she was born I felt like having had her was the biggest mistake of my life. In the beginning I thought that it was the baby blues I was going through, but the way I feel about my daughter never changed. Right now I’m in treatment for PPD, but I don’t think that I’m actually depressed. I’m just not cut out to be a mother, but of course I didn’t know that before I had my baby. It doesn’t help that my baby is extremely difficult, including medical issues and sleeping difficulties. She’s basically always either complaining, whining or straight out crying and wakes up at night every other 30-60 minutes. I haven’t really slept since she was born. I’m exhausted and I’m sorry to admit it, but 75% of the time I’m just annoyed with her. I just want her to not whine or cry for at least a few hours per day, but she won’t grant me any peace. My husband is extremely involved and apparently he is way more resilient than me because he is the one who actually treats the baby in a motherly manner. I’m feeling awful, literally like I’m the worst person on this planet. She is just a baby and she doesn’t do any of what she does to annoy me - I know that. But I’m so done with her. Most of the time I feel icky getting touched (and punched or kicked) by her. I just want her gone. I want my life back. I want my marriage back. I want to go back in time and redo the decision to have a baby. 

Will this feeling ever change? Will I ever be able to build a bond with my daughter? I don’t want her to have a crappy childhood because her mom sucks. I want her to become a mentally healthy and resilient person when she grows up, but I don’t know how to pass these things onto her when most of the time I wish I never had her.

But I wish I’d known how difficult this would be, how my marriage would suffer, how statistically smaller age gaps are linked to divorce, how drained and sad I’d feel most of the time, how I’d feel like I’m missing out on a hugely fun part in my toddler’s life because of this baby. My toddler is starting to really talk and interact and have interests, and is soo aware and obsessed with me and I feel so bad dividing my attention and being impatient with him because I’m worn out from caring for the baby at the same time.

I wish I’d known that my husband would basically be zero help in the mornings because he “needs to get ready for work” and refuses to get up earlier to do that so that he can help me get 2 kids fed (who conveniently usually both need to be fed at the same time ofc). I wish I’d known how difficult just getting out of the house and attending family events would be, how I’d have to run off mid convo with a relative because my 20mo is getting into something or asking for my help or my baby is crying to be held (usually at the same damn time).

then, my mother had another baby, who screamed and clung to me even more than my first sister. any social life i had before died almost instantly. i was coming to school completely exhausted, falling asleep in class, and yelling at people over nothing while my mother stayed at home with the baby during the day, dealing with ppd. i would take the baby almost immediately after i got home, mom eventually went back to work, and other sister got jealous and demanded attention. so then, i was dealing with parenting two screaming kids i never asked for.

my 3 year old sister just woke up crying from her nap because my 8 year old sister started screaming when i told her that i wasn't going to invite my friend over today since i'm really busy trying to keep up with school, and i dont even know what to do anymore. i love them both to death, but i wish i didnt have to be their mother. i feel like i'm being punished for doing a good thing, and i'm just so tired. my grades are slipping, the new friends that i made are getting worried, and all i want is to just be a normal kid. i don't even know what to do anymore. i just want it to stop

<<edit>>

wow, i didn't think i would get this much sympathy! thanks to everyone for your kind words, i'll try and take you up on some advice and have a genuine sit-down conversation with my mom once i get home and i'll also tell all of this to my counselor when i get the chance, rather than just leaving out pieces. i guess i've always struggled with telling people who could potentially take me away because i love my mom so much, and she works really hard to keep us housed, fed, and clothed. i might also tell my aunt too, she lived a couple states away but she is very supportive of me.

i think i'm gonna try and be offline a bit more to help, i noticed that the internet is kind of acting like a drug and distracting me from my family and responsibilities. i guess it's just easier to be here than to be in the real life, and i need to stop myself before i get too addicted. thank you to everyone again! hopefully things will work out",Likely mother: 5 > 1

HELP",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jxaeid/how_to_deal_with_10yo_step_daughters_bad/,"I am F(29) and my husband is (M)42. I really need advice because I can’t confide to anyone about this and I feel horrible about bad mouthing a child. My husband has 3 children, 2 boys and 1 girl. I’ve been in their lives for about 2 years. The boys are fairly cool and non chalant, respectful for the most part. But his daughter is very challenging and she has a lot of characteristics from her mom which is understandable. For context, my husband and his ex wife(mother of his kids) divorced because she was a narcissist who had complete control over him. She cheated on him stole money from him, verbally & mentally abused him and blamed him for all of her wrong doings. Their divorce was extremely messy but it was clear she only had kids with him for financial freedom. They haven’t been together for over 5 years and she is still starting drama with him mostly over money. They have 50/50 custody so we have them every other week. When I first met his daughter she was very sweet but when she came back from her moms house it was game over. I empathize with her because it’s not easy going back and forth especially since she grew up around constant toxic communication. My husband is a very soft spoken loving man but his ex wife is brings out the worst in him. Whenever his daughter comes back from her moms house she always has something extremely disrespectful to say for example she calls me a “Hoe” , makes fun of my appearance, and actually tries to turn me against her own dad by telling me things he “did” to her mom… obviously I know where it’s coming from. I’ve spoken to my husband about this and we’ve tried absolutely everything. He has talked to her 1 on 1 and has taken disciplinary actions towards her but I’m beginning to think that she is just who she is. She is constantly telling lies whether it’s about something small or serious. She comes home from school and tells us she’s being bullied but she is actually the one bullying all the little girls at her school, she makes fun of people for being “poor” or “ugly”. She is showing extreme signs of  step child syndrome but also showing major narcissistic characteristics from her mom. She is always stealing my things. She tells me to shut the fuck up. I’ve done everything from gentle discipline to putting my foot down and being stern. I love my husband unconditionally but this is taking a toll on my mental health. I’m not really sure how to go about this. I know I should be patient, empathic and understanding but this situation is making it really hard for me. She is super manipulative. The best way I can describe being around her is like being in a relationship with with a complete narcissist and that’s where traits of her mother come in. I feel bad for my husband too because even though she’s barely 10 she is constantly manipulating him to get what she wants just like her mother. I should also mention, she is very smart. It’s almost scary because all the awful things I’ve mentioned above, she does when nobody is looking. She would never say those things to me if her dad is around which makes it even harder since it’s always her word against mine but thank God my husband knows me. He knows I would never make things up. I’m just worried because she’s so young… I’m scared things will get worse especially when she becomes a teenager.

My son’s dad conned me into believing he had a vasectomy. First mistake. Then when I told him I was pregnant, he threatened me into keeping the baby and putting him on the birth certificate. 

I was in active drug addiction with him, in a violent narcissistic relationship that started out as my drug dealer. So I was already pretty lost.

He financially abused me so I wasn’t in a position to pay for an abortion and I talked with my dad and he sent the money but only to my mom who would accompany me and make sure the money went to that and not drugs. 

I did the education part of the appointment and chickened out. Then went back to my mom and asked her to take me again and she said no. To this day she claims she didn’t. I no longer have a relationship with her.

My son is mostly an angel but as a single mother who has him 100% of the time and struggles financially, I get rageful sometimes, when my son is giving me a hard time. Not at him but at the two abusers from my past.

Its getting easier, but I am not good at giving him attention. Mostly because I am a regretful parent but also because I struggle with mental health disorders.

I know it’s super selfish but I can’t help wishing that I could be someone else. Someone who isn’t burdened by a choice made when I was 14. We were all dumb at 14.

We've traveled twice before with our son, and for me personally, it was completely unenjoyable and stressful. 

My husband told me the other day he booked flights for us to fly 2/3 across the country for my birthday. I had told him before he did this that I was not interested in going anywhere with our toddler especially for my birthday because I simply will not enjoy it. He says we need a vacation because we work all the time and never go anywhere. Well, I don't want to go anywhere with our toddler. I prefer to have ""staycations"" until he's older and can do things on his own like use the toilet or grab himself a snack to eat. When I asked my husband to cancel the trip, he said he can't because the tickets are non-refundable, and then he said he did that on purpose so that I wouldn't have the option of backing out. How selfish can he be? 

Not to mention our toddler gets sick all the time. It's really not smart to make future plans like that when they'll likely get canceled due to illness. 

So, now here I sit fuming at my husband for his blatant disregard of my opinions and wants. I wonder if people would divorce over something like this.

I’m a mother of two—my son is 14 and my daughter is 6. I love them deeply, but I’ve had to come to terms with something really difficult: motherhood alone doesn’t fulfill me. I need more to feel whole. And that realization has shaken everything.

I recently earned the chance to return to Ireland to pursue graduate studies in archaeology—something that brings me alive in a way I’ve never felt before. My dream is to eventually live and work there, but it would mean living away from my children part of the time. And I don’t know how to sit with the pain of that. The guilt. The fear. The ache. The constant wondering: Am I selfish? Am I a bad mother for wanting this?

My husband and I are separating, in part because of this deep difference—he thrives in parenthood, and I… don’t. He believes I’m making a terrible mistake, and he’s angry, hurt, and resentful of my desires. I understand where he’s coming from, but I also feel like I’ve spent my entire life doing what was expected of me and slowly disappearing because of it.

I don’t know what the “right” choice is. I only know that if I stay in this life as it is now, I feel like I’ll vanish.
And if I go… I fear I’ll lose my kids, or that they’ll never understand why I left. I know I never should’ve had kids, but I did…and I love them dearly. And I am feeling absolutely torn apart by this decision. I feel like both options are horrible.

I guess I’m just here looking for anyone who has made a decision like this—or struggled with these feelings. How do you live with the aftermath, whatever you choose?

Almost 2 years ago, my partner of 8 years finally decided she wanted to have a child of her own, after years of me reminding her I would support her on that journey, as it’s something she’s wanted since before there was even an us. I’ve had 2 of my own, I’m too old to ever even consider getting pregnant again so anymore kids would have to come from her anyhow. Maybe I’ve just gotten a little too old, but I managed to work myself into a complete nervous breakdown between sleepless nights, working 50+ hour weeks, and relocating states so we can raise her with my partner’s family, and saying goodbye to my eldest kids and parents in doing so. I had to quit my job because I simply couldn’t take it all anymore and tried to commit suicide. I may not have been the one pregnant this time, but I’m certain I got the PPD anyhow. So by the time she was 7 months old, I became the stay at home mom, while my partner went back to work instead. Seemed like a solution since work was a huge stressor leading up to my stay in the psych ward. But over the last 4 months of being home and taking care of our child, I don’t feel any better.

Really, don't do that for someone else, even for the 'loved one', it will ruin your life.

'Ahhh but it gets better...' no, really, if you don't want kids, don't have them. Hell, if you don't DREAM OF HAVING KIDS, don't have them, honestly. It take too much time to 'gets better' IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

If the partner says too much on having kids, good for them, but don't fully trust. Usually the worse thing is the guy who says he wants, but then you discover he just wanted the good portion of it, and usually the mother will carry everything else, alone. And that sucks. A lot.

I can't stress enough: if you need to be convinced to have kids, don't do it, same applies to those CRAZY PEOPLE who wants it, don't 'convince' the other one, you'll regret.

If you want a long story:  
  
\- I considered myself an above average guy: average job, disciplined, nerdy, honest, athletic build, and, really, simple. Because here, just having a job and not being a criminal is above average.  
  
\- I met a girl that made me happy for the most of days, I could bear her flaws and the could bear mine too, we really enjoyed each other.

\- She always said she wanted kids, and I most of the time said that kids are a waste of time. Sometimes the though of having kids awoke my curiosity, but mostly, I've found too many issues to really like it. It would be too uncomfortable in our current situation (two average jobs, who would have time or energy?);

\- Still, I really liked her, and I stared pursuing money. Tried stocks, but my gains weren't much, and it was too stressful for me. Then landed on tech job, I really loved programming, so much that I was promoted 2 times that same year.

\- We weren't rich, but my job could afford us to be healthier and relaxed, money to pay all the bills, gym, better food, going out every week. Really, being healthy was so good, we desired each other so much, no cloudy thoughts or difficult in simple tasks for any of us. Life was great.

\- Because of that I was dumb enough to give another though on having kids. After all, it's only a baby, right? It's her dream, and being so good at my job, I could get everything done and have time to spare some help, right?

\- I still talked with a lot of different people about it, the answer was always there: the parents close to our age always said those cheesy things that we know isn't true (you'll know real love, it's tough but worth it, and sh\*t like that), even her granma said kids have no benefits at all.

\- But because I opened this door just a little, I was being constantly bombarded on how it would be a mild discomfort to my life and the realization of hers. On top of that, the said that she 'knew EXACTLY what to do to skyrocket our life quality' (she used EXACTLY) with kids, and that had so many years of experience that would be a walk in the park. 

\- Well, I was very satisfied with my current life, and adding a ""mild discomfort"" to make her dream come true did seem to be a big deal, so we went for it. I paid her some tech bootcamps, so she could have the same comfort and spare time as myself, I paid her every tool so she could be an influencer (that was one of 'EXACTLY' things that she 'knew how to do' and would skyrocket our life quality). Everything was set.

\- We had a lot of trouble to achieve that, but we did. Voilá, she was pregnant. From this day on I never relaxed again.

\- She didn't speak english well enough, so I needed to deal with every little thing, like appointments, exams, having her to understand every situation, oils, creams, dos and don'ts as parents while pregnancy...   
  
\- As it wasn't enough, we're having two, one of them had some troublesome situation that could be gone or not before birth, but nothing we could do something about it until 7-8 pregnancy months. So after the 3rd month, she stopped working for the safety of the babies.  
  
\- On top of that, I had to deal with her mother as well, because she was the 'smartass' about pregnancy and kids, but every little thing she spit on us was against medical advices... and she was raised to never question... 

\- I honestly felt a little overwhelmed dealing with so many things at once while working, but could manage well enough, but something felt off: whenever I asked about the bootcamp or the influencer thing, she was just evasive...  
  
\- Then they came, earlier than expected, and a journey of pure downfall just started... I know it's good to leave your comfort zone sometimes, but omg, I never came back to any comfort zone since then;  
  
\- I found out that those years of experience of hers barely catches up with a quarter of a parent book that they gave us in the hospital, 53 pages. We're sleeping 2 hours a day if lucky. I remember some days we just passed out in hospital, gladly the nurse team was kind enough.

\- She probably had blues or PPD becase of some issues related to her body and the babies, alongside with her mother complaining a lot, she was a narcisist so her daughter could not be imperfect, I had to defend her but in a polite way (I hated that, every fiber of my being just wanted to word-smack some sense into that heartless b\*tch);

\- My journey of dealing with everything just got beefed up, since now I was dealing with hers and their appointments, diapers, creams, formula and every stuff...   
  
\- She heartless b\*tch offered some help escorting the mother into appointments, but she doesn't have a much better english, and I just found that out when doctors just didn't take us seriously on further appointments, since we were 'contradicting' ourselves. So I need to be very 'assertive' with them, it was so stressful.

\- It was so that I needed to do some research by my own self to finally find the correct mix and dose of medication for my kids because doctors were shitheads.

\- Kids just had crying loud mode with occasional malfunctional that rebooted the system (naps);

\- I was awake 20 hours a day, solving problems non-stop while she 'recovers' from whatever she had that just paralyzed her as a functional human being. It 'rattled the cage' when I heard laughter and 'good time' in the night while I still was doing researches, and the next day she could not even go 2 miles from home to pick up some diapers...  
  
\- I tried very hard to put my own complaints about everything under a heavy rock, but sometimes one on another escaped. And, of course, I was always the villain. Telling her that I regret was like telling I did an horrendous crime, complaining about those cries and that we need to do something about it was dismissed with 'babies cries, it is what they do'.

\- I've grown resentful against her... like most of times it feels that I'm much more interested in their future than she is, and I don't even like them.   
  
\- For instance: I did the researches, I enforced some manners against everyone's wish (like don't hold them all the freaking time, when they're sleepy, put down on the crib, avoid letting fall sleep on shoulder, and things like that), but now they are jealous on how easy is to deal with these well mannered kids... I invented some 'deal with tantrum' activities and movements and wrote down, so anyone could deal easily... while she is just living day after day, feels that she isn't looking how to improve their or our lives because I'm the only one bringing something new to experiment.

\- That went for 4-5 months straight, until a night I just stood close to the cribs watching them crying out loud and tried to feed them, but they rejected one, two and three times, to get the fourth... I really felt I was about to snap, so I ran to the door and went barefoot in the streets, running as fast as I could to steam off...

\- Told her about it, dismissed again, but then I just told how serious that was, how broken I was to be so affected by something that little. She still didn't believe. I scheduled a therapist first thing in the morning and from that day on, she was like 80% of the time with them.

\- The therapist was surprised on how I've sustained that much without snapping, like people unalive themselves and/or their infant in those situations.

\- Our sleep went from 2 to 4 hours, 6 if we're lucky, because one of the kids is freaking picky eater and wants to eat decently in the middle of night, several times. The other one is the complete opposite, eats anything and sleeps all night and a little more. In contrast, he doesn't deal well with lack of freedom.

\- Now we split our efforts with some family members... while it give us some time to live, they are introducing bad manners onto those kids...

\- We're still together, but honestly, I think we're just doing that for the kids, I have my things, but I don't have the strength to work and deal with those little devils, she in the other hand, doesn't have where to go, but she says she likes them, most of the times.

She was 3 in December. As far as toddlers go she is difficult in that personality wise she is stubborn, defiant and independent. All great characteristics for an adult... maybe not for a toddler.

She was a good baby though. Slept through from 10 weeks and even before then maybe 2 wake ups a night.

We went out at the weekend with my friend who has 2 children. The oldest is the same age as my child and personality wise is very compliant. When it was time to leave, both of us (husband and me) were trying to get our daughter to leave the park...it took so long our friend had packed up both her children, given the 6 month old a nappy change and had driven off!!! It was made to look very easy!

Another friend yesterday announced she was pregnant with number 2 and i had this pang but then i thought if i had another it would be neglected as a newborn as I'd spend so much time chasing after the eldest. 

I am sort of thinking sticking with 1 might be the best option here. I don't doubt she will grow up with lots of friends, she is so confident and extroverted.

It's just the whole societal pressure.

I'd be interested in hearing a 'real' opinion of someone with 2 (I've read enough with a positive spin on the parenting subreddits).

Is it genuinely easier because they play together? (We have very limited village support so them entertaining each other would be my only breaks really).

Me and my gf were together for a few months before she fell pregnant so last year has been a toxic whirlwind.

Anyway i moved in with her and her daughter 7 just before our kid was born. Its been hell, argue all the time, high expectations to provide for her daughter while her dad gets a pass. 

Whenever we argue she says leave, now i pay half the bills so ive always said i live here u cant kick me out. I say that to try and keep our family together at least for the 1st year of my sons life. But i think its got to the point where i might have to just leave.

She's suffering from PPD so overall depressed doesnt go out or see friends etc. So i think shes taking out her stress on me, even her sis told me she was the same during her first pregnancy and took it out on her to so i should hang in there etc.

I get she has PPD but i also need to look after my peace and mental health. I already dont feel comfortable as ive moved into her home with her child, instead of to make me feel at ease and at home. Every chance she gets, she threatens to kick me out, i understand us arguing but i dont see why get out has to be the default answer what do you think?

Today shes said get out again after an argument, she said i can see my kid whenever i want but she needs space etc. Should i just pack up and go now, i really wanted to stay together the first year of our sons life but its too toxic.

I actually feel we'll both be happy seperated and i can still see my son whenever i want so i dont need to worry about that? What do you think im planning to ask her again if she wants me to leave and if she says yes i will, lastly surely she has to be quite a spiteful & emotional abusive person to threaten to kick someone out after every argument?

Im a regretful dad and i find parenting painful anyway to top it off the realtionship is awful to should i just cut my losses and coparent. Its not like i want to see the kids 24/7 id much prefer to do 50/50 or weekends tbh.",Likely father: 4 > 3

07 April 2025,Father regrets having kids,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jtdw55/father_regrets_having_kids/,"My spouse has been the sole breadwinner for 3 years now and I have been a full-time sahm against my choice in a broken job market. Kids are 11 and 8. 

I searched for any kind of decent work for 1.5 years or more, and ended up with nothing more than a beefed up resume and identity theft back in 2024. I've been open to part-time, casual or full-time work for the right position. Finally I got a job that in hindsight was not properly vetted (on either side) and I quit during training. Turns out the money offered was not enough, and there was even wage theft going on. Glad it's in the rear view all things considered. 

Sometime during the time I spent job searching, I got the bright idea to start a work from home business but my spouse was not receptive. It's only been just now that he is accepting and willing to go forward with it. If all goes to plan, I can operate this fall, and he can contribute a handful of hours every week. Bonus, he can fully quit the temp agency he has been using as a side hustle for quite some time. I even said this opportunity has potential for full-time hours even if just for a few years until things are revisited. 

It basically came to a head for me today with his anger and childish outbursts. I'm not taking it standing anymore. I suggested anger management, meds, you name it. He has stress going on w the union at his workplace and there are a lot of rumors at work at the threat of a strike. He hates the union and wishes it didn't exist. He is worried he will lose his job and we will foreclose on our home. He really catatrophizes. Yes we are not living in the lap of luxury with thousands of dollars of mad money every month, but we get by and everything is paid. The odd mini dip into the red that is rectified shortly thereafter. Not too bad for a family clearing 80k a year. We have accessed a food hamper on occasion to get us over this hump with unemployment on my end. I like working, contributing, and making an income. Regardless, he says we are hemorrhaging money and he feels like we can't get ahead. 

He told me he hates his life and he feels like a fraud and he should have sterilized himself like his brothers. I'm honestly losing empathy and compassion at this point. I've  been the primary parent and worked outside of the home for all but the last 3 years of a nearly 15 year relationship. I even worked nights and provided childcare during the day until I was finally hospitalized for my mental health disorder many years ago. No more nights, period. 

I've brought up splitting up, and for him to pay me child support. I've said he can drive off into the sunset and live a more authentic life. I feel like he is just wallowing in self hated and self pity; he feels he has nothing of importance to provide the kids, and he said he doesn't want to be close to his own son. He feels like a shell of a person. He says he is inundated with me and the kids when all he has to do is make a plan for alone time or friend time, whatever. He is not tethered to me. I've been trying to encourage him to ask a guy friend or 2 out for a beer. He has went to overnight festivals. Club event nights. I'm not some controlling wife. 

All he does is work 50+ hours per week and do the odd fun outing with the kids on the weekend, where he feeds them fast food etc. He is mostly checked out otherwise. I mentioned to him that sometimes getting ready to go out is harder with him around. Its like he is just HERE sometimes. I spend an hour getting ready and then im always th one expected to get kids ready too. He didn't even engage with the kids at all today. We argued a bit, he showered and went to bed. 

I visited my mom Friday and he cooked for the kids after school but doesn't even properly clean the kitchen, just makes it tidy. He purges and organizes when he is motivated, and he is looking forward to spring cleaning which I'm excited about. Overall, I keep the house in great order. He seemed to have a decent time with the kids. But overall, I think he is just going through the motions. 

He doesn't believe in psychiatry or psychology/counseling. I said to him tonight he needs to seek out anger management and get some type of help. His workplace even suggested it years and years ago but he never followed through. It's getting to be a non-negotiable. Something has got to give.

But he's not even a weekend parent because the only full day he has his child is on Saturday. I wake up at the ass crack of dawn to pick my child up on Sundays and he picks her up from school on Fridays. 

I hate that I have to take her to every appointment she needs. I hate that he doesn't ask about any appointments but is so vocal about how she doesn't need ADHD medication because she's just a kid. How would someone who barely knows their own kid know what they do or don't need? I'm putting her on medication soon once I find the right one. To hell with her dads opinion.

I hate how my child just doesn't eat. We all think she has ARFID and has an appointment next week with a feeding therapist but it's been literally years of hell just begging my child to try a new food. I hate how my child is six and just simply won't eat. I hate how I've tried everything and had zero success 

I hate being a mother, and yet being the only one who parents. My daughter is loud and disrespectful and makes life hell for anyone who tries to discipline her or tell her what to do. I hate how she literally can't sit still and must always be bouncing off the walls unless a screen is in front of her. 

I hate how she cries every time she leaves her dads house because she loves him so much, but never cries for me because I have to be the disciplinarian.

I hate that I was hoping to never have to put my child into such a toxic environment like I was raised in but I don't have a choice. I hate how I'll never have the chance to be the fun, part time parent like her father. Everytime I try and take her on a fun trip with just us I get so overwhelmed by her behavior I always regret taking her out. Even if she has a good time I'm convinced I'll never have a good time as long as I constantly have to be on top of her every second of the trip.

I hate how disrespectful her father is to me. I hate how much he talks down to me and treats me like dirt and I have to take it for the sake of never saying anything negative about her father and risking her overhearing it.

I hate how I'm the one who never wanted any of this and yet I'm the only one saddling all of the responsibility. I hate how I got pregnant on birth control and talked myself out of the abortion. I hate that my health has had to fall on the back burner so I can make sure my daughter has what she needs. I hate that I'm stuck at an abusive job with long hours because bills need to be paid. I hate how every option for my child, if I leave, is somehow worse than me. I can't leave her with my parents. I can't leave her with her father. I can't leave her with the state or another family member. I feel trapped. I hate how everything feels like my fault because I'm not doing enough.

I hate waking up early to make sure she gets to school and I hate having to pick her up. I hate how her father refuses to take her to school and I'm the primary parent so it falls on me if she misses school. 

I hate how this feels like forever. I hate how everyday is the same. No breaks. No end in sight. I hate how much I actually love my daughter enough to put myself through all this for the hope that she ends up more successful than I am. I also hate that I yearn for the day my daughter inevitably winds up wanting to live with her dad because he's the fun one and maybe then he can get a taste of his own medicine.

But despite all that, I love when my daughter has moments where she hugs me and tells me she loves me. Makes me feel like I'm doing something right, even if I don't know what it is.",Likely mother: 15 > 2

I'm a stay at home mom but I do EVERYTHING for both my kids & my husband (cleaning, meals, appointments, all the scheduling of things including car maintenance, morning routines & bedtimes, baths, and diapers and it's exhausting.

Ive always struggled with putting myself first, so now when everybody needs me or needs something from me all day, every day, even though it's destroying me, I just suck it up.

I used to smile & laugh all the time.  I had dreams & goals and hobbies.  Now I'm just taking care of everyone all the time. This isn't some sort of PPD, it's just my life as I know it now.

04 April 2025,I hate my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jrk7rg/i_hate_my_life/,"I love my son with all my heart but I regret starting a family. I have an amazing career in tech with lots of travel every year, my dream car and my own home. When I met my husband, we talked about having a family and I was all for it. As time went on, his financial instability (always unemployed), selfishness and reckless behavior made me change my mind about having kids because I already had one…my husband. 

Anyway, an ultimatum and one baby later, I am now not only the breadwinner but the house maid and primary parent. During and after my pregnancy, my husband found himself unemployed again and slept almost all day and all night. His only waking hours were spent smoking weed and playing videos games. Going through the newborn phase made me want to unalive myself almost everyday. I spent days breastfeeding without having any food because he wouldn’t cook or even order anything while I’m sleep deprived, hurting from stitches with a baby that wanted to sleep on me 24/7. I had to beg and cry just for something to drink. 

Last month, I told him that I am not having any more kids and that I would happily give him a divorce so he can find someone else to have that big family that he’s been dreaming of. Since then he’s made a comment about “When we have a daughter…” to which I replied “we? I’m done having kids.” He just doesn’t seem to get it. But why would he? Parenting is performative for him…pictures, video calls with his family and pretending to be the perfect dad in public while I’m the one who feeds, changes, cleans , packs diaper bags, preps baby food, buys everything, establishes sleep routines, pays all the bills, stresses about putting food on the table, etc. 

Parenthood is hard work and I wish people were more truthful about how much it sucks for women especially. There is nothing amazing about it (other than surviving childbirth I guess). I look forward to the day when my son naps for longer than 5 minutes, when I can actually eat uninterrupted, when I can shower guilt free, when I can have a good night’s sleep.

But before all this happened my mom pressured to me have a kid & keep it also to have to it young, “oh you should have a kid so you can grow up” “I wish I had a grand baby” “I’ll help you” then once I had flip it on me not helping me out saying it’s my problem. (but my mom doesn’t know I was technically SA’d by my ex multiple times throughout my relationship w/him including while pregnant w/his son he would forced himself on me)

fast forward to now my son is special needs he has some chromosomal abnormality (pathogenic deletion 400kb on chromosome 3p26.1.) there isn’t much research on it but now the most he has global motor delay, & sensory processing difficulty. This all show up at my blood work back when I was 19 I wish would have aborted him at that time but hospital forced & gulit trip to keep him saying he “would be normal” that isn’t a “big deal” if I would abort him at that time life would be atleast normal I would of moved out by now, I would have a career in my field, I would finally cut off ties w/my toxic ass family, & everyone here but right now I look forward is unalive myself by age of 30. 


I have nothing going for me im essentially forced to be alive for this child who just barely learned how to use toilet on his own, I have put on his clothes for him, he cant feed himself, he cant wipe himself, yes he’s smart on things but it’s so fuckin draining. I can’t go anywhere not even for like 2 hrs he starts complaining to my mom to come home…

Hear me out 5 months in, newborn trenches, first time dad really not enjoying it, not feeling any attachment or love still doing everything night feeds etc and supporting my partner but no real joy or love.

From the outside i probably seem like a great hands on dad and i am, but i dont do it out of joy more obligation, maybe it will get better as he gets older.

For instance when im looking after him im not constantly playing with him i get bored, i play with him and kiss me etc but its with way less enthusiam than i see other guys doing it with. 

For me its kind of like a chore it sounds bad, it has to get done so ill do it but i wont do it smiling. Maybe its just because its really hard newborn phase though.

When he grabs my hand i dont feel anything, when he smiles i smile back but i dont get this warm fuzzy feeling. My child was unplanned and im unmarried, me and my partner arent really right for eachother we argue alot but were just trying to stick it out as long as we can.

I fear ill be the kind of dad that just tolerates his children, rather than genuinely enjoys there company. Its kind of sad i LOVE my niece and nephew it literally gives me a warm fuzzy feeling taking them out or seeing them smile. But with my own i dont feel the same? 

Perhaps its all the responsiblity im not the fun uncle im actually a dad, im not just doing fun stuff with them im actually doing all the parental hardship that comes along with it so maybe thats why im not enjoying it. Maybe its because my relationship isnt going well either and it was unplanned to, perhaps if i was with my wife lets say and i planned to have him it would be different.

Im not sure i think im too selfish too, i never realised how much i enjoy my own time and now i have 0 of it maybe thats why its leading to me feeling like this, what do you all think?",Likely father: 3 > 0

We had a miscarriage after a little over two months of going official into our relationship, I was upset, it stuck with me for a few months, I have a feeling it affected him a lot more. I remained on the fence about having children, regardless, this only amped up his determination to have a kid, it seems. I get it. He's an amazing dad, he was cut out for this life, I was not. A lot of people my age, these days, are just enjoying their lives, no hindrance, no responsibilities, there is absolutely no way a man will convince me to go through this shit again (including the father of my child).

03 April 2025,Why do I keep on doing this to them?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jq9pof/why_do_i_keep_on_doing_this_to_them/,"⸻

Hey everyone,

I just created this account very recent and to be honest, I’m not very tech-savvy—so please be kind. Constructive criticism is always welcome. Over the last few days, I’ve been looking for a place where I can talk openly with people I don’t know, so here goes.

I’m a 42-year-old single mother of five. I’ve been on my own since I was 17, and even before that, I knew I wanted to be independent. By 14, I was determined to make it on my own, and by 17, I was working two jobs to afford my first apartment.

Life wasn’t easy, especially having kids at a young age, but I always found a way to push through. We didn’t have much, but I always made sure there was food on the table and a roof over our heads. Then, five years ago, things changed—I started my own business, and it took off beyond anything I could have imagined.

Two years later, I was financially stable enough to buy my first house. You guys have no idea how much that meant to me. For the first time in my life, I could look my kids in the eyes and say, This is our home. No more moving because a landlord wants to sell. No more uncertainty. I know some might think, Well, it took you over 30 years to buy a house when people nowadays do it in their 20s, but I was—and still am—so proud of that accomplishment.

Here’s where things took a turn. In my excitement, I didn’t fully think things through. I put all my savings into the down payment and closing costs. My mortgage is $6,000 a month at a 7.5% interest rate. I know—it was a huge risk. But at the time, I was making over $250K a year, so I thought I was fine.

Then, just two months after moving in, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. At first, I could still manage, just not at full capacity. I had been doing nails for over 20 years, so I decided to sell my salon and start an online business from home. It seemed like a good plan, especially since around that time, my youngest son was diagnosed with autism. I needed to be home for him anyway, as his therapy required a specialist to come five days a week.

But then, my health declined even more. A month later, I could barely stand. If you ask anyone who knows me, they’ll tell you I’m strong, stubborn, and never let anything stop me. But now? I’ve been bedridden for two weeks. I feel weak, embarrassed, and, worst of all, like I’ve failed my kids.

Just today, I left a voicemail for my realtor, letting them know I need to sell the house because I can’t afford it anymore. And as much as it breaks me, I don’t see another way.

I’m not going to act on it, so don’t worry, but for the first time in my life, I found myself thinking, If I could just fall asleep and not wake up, I wouldn’t have to face my kids and tell them what’s happening. That thought scared me.

My oldest daughter is in college, and her friend told me she’s so stressed about me that she’s considering quitting school to come help. That shattered me. Before I got sick, I promised her she could finally just be a kid again after years of stepping up to help raise her siblings. I refuse to let her throw away her future because of me.

On top of everything, I know I should go to the doctor, but I’m terrified. The last few times, they’ve pushed for me to have heart surgery to replace a valve. I know it might sound crazy to refuse, but financially and emotionally, I’m just not ready. With my condition, the recovery time could be twice as long as normal—if everything goes well. Before I even consider it, I need to know my kids will be okay while I’m down for at least two months.

I don’t know why I’m posting all this—I guess I just needed to get it out before I spiral further and I’m looking for suggestion on how I’m able to save my house. I’m currently two months behind on the mortgage, i’m hoping that when I’m done with all my surgery and stuff I’m able to get back to my business so any insights and help would be greatly appreciated. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for listening. I could really use some insight… or even just an air hug.",Unclear: 0 / 0

02 April 2025,Burned out on life,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jpty84/burned_out_on_life/,"I'm so glad I discovered this sub because my feelings have been festering and I felt like a heartless monster until I found out I'm not the only person who feels this way. My (M31) fiance gave birth to our firstborn about 10 weeks ago. Ever since then I've become a shell of the human I once was. She immediately had a bond with him from day 1, and it's honestly been a privilege to watch her maternal instincts blossom. She is such a good mother and it hurts my heart that I'm not just as good a parent.  I'm struggling so hard right now as a new father, in a way that I never thought I would. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think this would be sunshine and rainbows, but holy shit this is the hardest thing I've ever done. Let me preface this post with: I WILL NEVER WALK OUT ON MY FAMILY, ABANDON MY CHILD, OR FORCE MY PARTNER TO BE THE SOLE CARETAKER OF OUR BABY.  

  
I work a full-time job during the week and drive uber on the weekends just to keep the lights on and put food on the table, but due to our debt, it's not enough. Even as I type this we're a month behind on the car note and will be a month behind on the mortgage by the end of April. My fiance can't work a full-time job because our baby needs her at home and we can't afford daycare. Fortunately her parents live in-town and they can watch him from time-to-time when they aren't working so she can pick up serving shifts at her old job, which helps. But most days I wake up, go to work, come home, and get handed a screaming baby that needs feeding and changing and burping, and before I know it,  I wake up and go to work again. The weekends are the same. The few precious moments I have to myself during my commute are all I have anymore. I used to play DND, Magic the Gathering, go rock climbing, hang out with friends, host parties, etc. All of that has gone out the window. 

  
I went sober almost two years ago for mental health reasons and I stopped smoking weed before our son was born so I could be more present for him. I feel so unseasoned as a person now. Not that I need those substances to feel like myself, but it felt nice to let loose with my fiance after a hard day of work. I remember the days we would get dressed to the nines, eat an edible, drive to the big city, have a few drinks at a couple bars, eat some bomb ass food at one of our favorite spots, come home, smoke a joint, fuck each other's brains out, and be all smiles the rest of the week because we had such a good time together. Fuck, even the nights where we would just smoke a joint and watch tv were heaven compared to now. 

  
We had an argument last night about how we're feeling, and my fiance asked me if I loved our son. I told her ""no"" and she started crying, which made me feel like shit. I told her I honestly view him as a parasite. He's the reason we don't get any sleep anymore, he's the reason we're broke, and he's the reason we can't even go out past 6:00pm anymore. Calling him a parasite was definitely a bad move, but I wanted to be honest with how I was feeling. I told my fiance I loved her because we formed a relationship through weeks, months, and years of getting to know each other and forming a bond, and we've gone through so much shit together that I literally feel as if we are connected through mind, body, and soul. Now I'm expected to love this creature that I've known for a few months that I can't even have a conversation with in the same fashion? Fuck that. My only feelings toward him are that of obligation; the only instinct I have is to provide. I reassured her that once his personality starts to show up and I can form a bond with him that I will most likely fall in love with our precious baby boy. I'm honestly looking forward to being a dad in that regard. But even then she asks if the moments where he's calm and smiles up at me are worth it. As much as I admittedly LOVE those moments, the lack of sleep, mental health decline, financial ruin, etc. are NOT worth the maybe 2 minutes per day he's a dream baby.



Don't get me wrong, we made the conscious decision to have this child. We had the opportunity to turn back, and now it's too late. I'm man enough to own that and do whatever it takes to give this child a good life. I'll do whatever it takes to be a good father, both as a provider and as an emotional rock for my son. I want to love him, and there are moments when I think I do, but mostly I just feel resentment towards him. I feel like my life got off-track and I'm missing the person I used to be.",Unclear: 4 / 4
02 April 2025,Women are treated like shit postpartum,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jpqnu4/women_are_treated_like_shit_postpartum/,"I came across a post made by my husband on a different group where he vented about how I regret motherhood and how because of this, it's negatively impacted our marriage. Everyone was very quick to jump on the postpartum depression bandwagon that he just needs to leave me and get out of our marriage. Very common comments were ""Get her to a doctor asap! She NEEDS help."" or ""You need to attend her next gyno appointment for her and make sure she brings up her mental health to her provider.""  or my favorite ""Postpartum depression isn't always depression! It can be in the form of regret or disliking of their own baby! Get her help immediately."" The way people talk about moms is scary and it's no wonder so many women don't get help or even voice how they feel. 



Do we ever stop to think that maybe some women realize the major sacrifices they have made that have now permanently not only altered their body, but also their lives? I'm so sick of people putting how I feel on postpartum depression or my hormones... My husband included. He told me the other day that he hopes my feelings towards our son will change once my hormones regulate back to normal... Here's some insight on my life and how it's changed since having our baby (2 months old now). 



I run my own business out of our home/property. I work roughly 12-16 hours a day every single day of the week. The original plan was that I would work and take care of the baby while my husband was at his job. Then when my husband would come home, he would take over with the baby stuff so I could finish working myself... That did NOT happen. Our son is very colicky, like terribly... My mom & sister both work professionally with kids aging from babies to toddlers and both have said he's extremely colicky and fussy. Each day I was struggling to get any work done as this baby would not stop crying! My husband asked his mom to move in to help with the baby. This way she could watch the baby while he was at work, I could also get my work done, and the baby's needs would be met. 



While I am grateful of the scarifies she has made to move in and help with her grandson, my home is no longer my own. I do not feel comfortable walking out in my underwear to make my coffee in the morning before a long day ahead of me. I can't have private conversations with my husband in regard of our son, our relationship, and my own personal life. I can feel her judgement when I go off into the bedroom to pump during the day as I will throw on a show and watch it while pumping. When I am working on my computer and not doing the physical aspect of my job, I can sense her judgement as I just ""sit around"". 



On top of my job, I am also the one caring for the home. My mother in law and husband do not clean... It's all left to me. I wake up in the morning and clean, work for 12-16 hours, and then clean again in the evening. It's never ending between a baby, my husband, my mother in law, and myself.

❌❌❌ NO ADVICE  ❌❌❌

I can't believe after this many days people are still telling me their magic solutions to a situation they actually DON'T understand the first thing about - because I haven't explained it here - *because the point of the post is just to vent my feelings NOT GET ADVICE*

If you think you ""know"" my situation and what I should do about it, STFU and go elsewhere, because you've got no idea.

-----
My kid is a young adult and I just want her to get the fuck out of my home. I'm so tired of spending the better part of the last 20 years not being allowed to prioritise myself. 

I feel like tearing my hair out waiting for her to do the most basic things like get a learners permit for driving classes, or apply for the part time job she keeps saying she wants to get but ""isn't ready yet"" whatever that means. She's supposed to be studying but I know she is skipping classes, rarely does anything at home unless I push her, and spends most of the day on the couch. I work all day and come home exhausted, and then still have to cook a meal while she plays games because she's ""not ready"" to learn to do it herself. 

I'm middle aged, and I have plans and dreams I can't even start working towards because I'm forced to support someone who keeps putting off growing up. This week she had the audacity to ask if a friend could move in here and I nearly screamed. I can't even deal with one of you being here, and you expect me to put up with another??

Please don't ask me if I've considered this or that, or about her mental health or other possible reasons behind this. There's a lot of reasons. Just some days I don't give a fuck about reasons and need it to be over.

Today has been one of the hardest, most miserable, most soul-crushing days I’ve had as a parent, and I don’t even have the words to describe how done I feel. I am exhausted, I am furious, I am overwhelmed to the point where my whole body feels like it’s vibrating with stress. If this is “the beautiful chaos of two under two,” then I want nothing to do with it.

My son (17 months) is teething, which apparently means his entire personality has been replaced by pure, unfiltered rage. Screaming unmercifully, throwing himself on the floor, beating me, beating the dogs, his sister. Clawing the skin off my face one minute then clinging to me the next. My daughter (4 months) spent the entire fucking day either crying, screeching until the veins in her head were protruding, or just totally attached to me. If I dared to put her down, even for a second, she lost it. So I spent the whole day trying to balance one child in my arms while the other sobbed and attempted to gouge my eyes out, both of them competing for who could make my life the most unbearable.

I feel like I’m drowning. No—drowning would be peaceful compared to this. This is suffocating, relentless, inescapable. I haven’t eaten a proper meal, I haven’t sat down, I haven’t had five fucking minutes where someone wasn’t screaming in my face. I feel trapped. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I feel like I’ve made the worst decision of my life having them this close together.

And the guilt—oh my God, the guilt. For resenting my own children. For hating every second of this. For wondering if I would be happier if I had just waited, if I had just thought this through instead of listening to all the people who said “Oh, it’ll be hard but so worth it!” Right now? It doesn’t feel worth it. It feels like I’ve ruined my life. And I hate myself for feeling that way.

I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I just needed to scream into the void, because I feel like if I don’t, I might actually explode. If you’ve been here, if you’ve survived this, please tell me it gets better. Because today has made me wonder if it ever will.",Unclear: 0 / 0

01 April 2025,I hate being a mother,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jovequ/i_hate_being_a_mother/,"Five years ago, I was suffering my worst bout of depression to date. I learned how unsupportive my partner was then and had already planned to break things off to give me the space to get it together. I soon found out I was pregnant and my plans were put on hold. I considered abortion as we didn't expect the pregnancy to make it past 12 weeks due to my prior health issues. It did and my mental health was improving. I got excited and focused entirely on preparing for baby.

He was born right before covid and the first couple of years were wonderful. I was able to stay home with him and focus entirely on being the best mom I could be. Things with my partner did not improve and we split. 

My son and I moved back to my parents' and it's been hell since. Son's dad works too much to really contribute to parenting besides the occasional Sunday outing. My parents undermine me as a mother and refuse to respect every boundary, rule and routine I set. They are also emotionally unintelligent and unregulated and often have explosive arguments. This has made my son difficult to handle as he's become spoiled,  manipulative, and disrespectful, combined with a suspected ADHD diagnosis. He also doesn't respect boundaries and rules and his tantrums are extremely violent. 

I used to live with hope that if I got us out into our own place, it would get better. He'd have a single authority figure, structure and consistency. I don't claim to be the perfect mother, but I'm the only adult in his life that puts effort into becoming better. I'm in therapy and am putting him in it as well (his father and my parents think therapy is stupid).

That hope has been diminishing as I watch things worsen. My son has disciplinary issues at school almost every day, the tantrums are increasingly destructive and instead of getting support from his father or my parents, I only get more obstacles. My mental health has rapidly declined in the last few months. And the harder I try, the more my son hates me. I've grown bitter and tired. Sometimes I even fantasize about dropping him off at his father's doorstep and disappearing. Or maybe faking my death, or maybe actually dying. The only thing stopping me from doing any of those things is that I would hate to give anyone, let alone my kid, that kind of trauma. 

I didn't sign up for this. I live with a heavy guilt that I brought a kid into a broken family and a shit environment set on making him a shit person. 
I would've never had a child if I knew I'd be dealing with this on my own.

31 March 2025,Do I hate being a parent due to my child’s bad temperament or because I was never meant to be a mom?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1joccsx/do_i_hate_being_a_parent_due_to_my_childs_bad/,"I’m a newbie here. Have clicked into this subreddit a few times and then quickly left, telling myself that I’m not a regretful parent… but here I am 8 months into being a first time mom and I fear I’d fit in quite well here. 

Today I screamed at my 8 month old in the car multiple times out of frustration and it made me step back and reflect on how I feel about my life now post-baby. We took a ride to target to do a quick return and she was so difficult the entire trip: cried and screamed getting into the car seat, cried in the car ride there, cried and whined in the shopping cart, took her out of the cart and held her and then she still fussed and pushed me away, put her back in the cart and she continued fussing despite offering her multiple toys and items off the shelves to keep her busy. Cried in the line for Starbucks and fussed in my arms while we waited for the drink, cried and screamed when she got back into the car seat and then cried the entire 7 minute ride home. 

This is my life every single day. She is a miserable baby. She has cried constantly since the day she was born. Everyone told me it was “colic” and it would pass. I never thought I was going to make it through the first 4 months… I did, but it never improved. I’ve reached a breaking point. I’m starting to feel no connection with her anymore and I blame her for ruining my life (I know this isn’t her fault - she didn’t ask to be born), but I no longer have any hope that parenthood will get better. 

My husband says “she’s just a baby” and that this behavior is normal and expected and will pass. I don’t agree with him… friends of mine with babies do not have kids that are constantly this high maintenance, disgruntled and unhappy. Am I just a bad mom with unrealistic expectations?

I get generic messages back like ""try to make time for self care!"" or ""the days are long but the years are short!"" that type of thing.  6 people that should care a little about me, I don't live near any of them except husband, so its not even their fault, so I'm not really sure what I was expecting by venting to them. But I had a realization that no matter how hard this is, how miserable I am, there's no one coming to help, I think a part of me thought if i tell my mom (or someone else) about it, she'll do something, a break is coming. But its not,  unless I figure a way to outsource some of the responsibilities. That gave me the push. I'm going to go into debt to pay for daycare for my 3 year old starting next year.

Similar with my older kid. if one was healthy, the other was sick it felt like. I donno just thought some of you guys would relate to the fact that no one is going to come take your kid to the zoo and let you catch up on cleaning or sleep. And if you want to do those things it comes with significant cost.  But I can't figure out a different way to not be miserable because its just day in day out of cleaning, cooking, bathing, homework, laundry, etc etc. I want to watch a movie and take a bath and organize my closet and there just isn't enough time after the kids go to bed to fit it into since i'm beyond exhausted from taking care of them all day.

I felt guilty for even googling it but after a few therapy sessions that I don’t feel like really helped me with these intrusive thoughts on regretting bringing 3 beautiful children into this horrible world on my own free will, I find myself super disgusted for even feeling this way, but it’s the truth and I know I have to acknowledge and sit with these thoughts and thank goodness for who ever created this space because just reading some of the comments makes me feel validated and not alone in this, unlike ANY therapy sessions has ever done for me. Here’s a little backstory from me, I’m 31yo and had my first child at 18 and again at 19. I remember like it was yesterday I was a teenager going through a phase of wanting to be pregnant. For some reason a lot of girls at my high school were trying to and on top of that, I was in a very disfunctional household so you know, I was the child that ran away and hung around the wrong crowd. I just wanted someone or something to love me or honestly, now that I’m typing this, I wanted to have my own family that I can pour into like I wish I had when I was young. Anyway, I ended up having my 3rd when I was 28, don’t ask me why. I honestly didn’t start having these thoughts until after my 3rd child was born. Her family is a great support system. They helped me go back to school and become an RN. They treat me like their daughter and show up for me and my sons (my first two kids). I am not married and a single mom and although I do make decent money to care for them, I struggle with trying to pour into them when I’m only one person. I do find myself wishing I stopped at one ☝🏽. I also find myself comparing myself to childless women on social media who was smart enough to go to college, build a career and just live their best child free life traveling ect. I have a little sister in her mid twenties who I find myself envying sometimes because she’s wayyy more aware then I was at her age because she actually ways her options on whether becoming a mom is the right thing for her. Sometimes I beat myself up and call myself a dumbass because I do feel like I let trauma and disfunction aide me in my decision to wanting to be a mom instead of using logic. I know that sounds very idiotic because you would think that trauma and disfunction would’ve had the opposite effect. Anyway, I’ll end this rant here! Thanks for listening",Likely mother: 5 > 0

All I know is my non kids friends are off on holiday 4x a year and seem unstressed and none are crying about not having kids!

28 March 2025,Husband wants more kids…,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jlvh1b/husband_wants_more_kids/,"EDIT @ bottom

My husband has always dreamed of having a large family (4-8 children). And at first I thought that’s what I wanted too… Until going through pregnancy, birth (which suffered complications leaving me traumatized), and now actually having to care for an extremely colicky baby… Now I changed my mind. I don’t want a large family. I’ve told my husband this because I don’t want to lead him on with thinking I still do. I also have fully been open and admitted I hate being a mom and I stick around for him and our marriage, not the baby. 

I’ve talked to him that I want to potentially get my tubes tied. He was really upset about the idea. He asked if I would try birth control. I told him no, hormonal birth control doesn’t do well with me and I’m not interested in an IUD. I don’t want to put myself through pain again just for a TEMPORARY solution to prevent pregnancy. I also don’t want other people’s influence like social media, family, friends, basically society on top of hormones, to end up influencing another poor decision to have another kid. 

My husband was upset of course. But he said he’d support whatever makes me happy. He said he’d give up the dream of a large family to keep the one he has with me because he loves me and our son so much. So I’m thinking we are on the same page.

Last night I asked him his thoughts on a vasectomy. I know in the past, granted this was when he thought we’d have a lot of kids, said he’d get a vasectomy. He said “Why would I get one done? I’m not done having kids.” And I said “I am… I don’t want any more.” He goes quiet. This is not a news flash for him. We’ve been talking about this for quite some time… My husband isn’t one to just start being quiet mid conversation either. So I asked him “If you’re not done having kids, who are you planning to have kids with because I’m not having any more…” Again, silence. 

We go to bed and I don’t want to cuddle or anything. I just want to be left alone. He asks why I’m mad. Honestly it’s not even mad, it’s just more or less now I’m contemplating my life entirely. Do I just leave? Give up my parental rights? Do I just go and tubal done? I know most people would just say use a condom, but can you really trust that? 

I’m frustrated. I’m resentful. I’m hurt. 

EDIT: 
I'm not stating that my husband HAS to get a vasectomy. I only asked because this was something he brought up when I was pregnant that he would be open to getting one. For those stating that I shouldn't have asked or that he should not have to get one, mind you, him and I are MARRIED. Marraige is a partnership. Where I see it, I have sacrificed a lot just to have this 1 child of his. If he WANTS THIS FAMILY & MARRIAGE then it shouldn't be unrealistic of him to get a vasectomy. If he DOES NOT want this marriage & family, then by all means, do not get one and go find some woman who has to push out 4-8 babies for you while also being the breadwinner of your family.",Likely mother: 8 > 0

Beforehand my brother and sister where so eager to see my young kids again! They rarely see them.

During the entire weekend they only interacted briefly with the kids while passing by. At some point everyone was lounging on sofas while I was playing ball with my son in front of them. After waking up waaaaay before everybody else and me and wife doing everything that is needed to keep the kids fed and happy already. Next time I will hint my brother that ""my son would love to shoot some ball with him"" because it really takes only 15 minutes of undivided attention to make him talk about it for days. (""Uncle Hank and I played soccer and I won!!"")

I talked about this to my neighbour and she told me about the family dinners in restaurants where they are stressing to feed the kid, cleaning up the mess another made while everyone else is relaxing and eating their food.

No matter what I do for my children they are entitled and rude. I've always been a kind and helpful person up until recently. One of my sons friends and his brothers is abused and neglected by his family and still are.  The youngest brother has been adopted and is probably in the best situation. The middle boy has been abandoned by his family due to his behaviour and is now in a permanent care home for young people. The oldest is now living with his uncle and uncles partner. The uncle is the most vile sick in the head coward of the whole family. Whilst the two oldest were living with their step grandmother as a kinship fostering agreement prior to the current situation, she also neglected and abused the two boys physically and emotionally. I tried my best to give the two boys some love and care and they saw me as a benevolent father figure. The uncle didn't like this so created a situation where I was accused of pursuing a romantic relationship with the older boy because he says I love you to me and vice versa. Everything blown out of proportion and I'm investigated by social services where they found no cause for concern. The pettiness was phenomenal and all I got was an apology from the social workers for making me feel so much shame. I was sexually abused as a young teenager. My three children are so angry about it all and my son says he wants to kill the uncle. I never wanted this for my children and it was all started by me trying to be kind to an eleven year old boy starving and wandering around at all hours like a street rat. My three children have been traumatised by all this and it's my fault.

Societal expectations and conditioning have played a huge role. I feel like I am failing at motherhood, though I try my best. My child is delayed in several milestones & 1.5 years. So it's even harder. The fights with spouse are insane.

People say it gets better, but does it? I had a good career, everything was going so well and I had to have this child. Grandparents kept insisting they want a grand kid and all I got was taunts at post partum 3 months when my in-laws were visiting. Instead of supporting me, all I got was how imperfect I am and how I should do more. 

Spouse is a good Dad but yes overworked and tired too, so we have a lot of fights. My own mother didn't understand how hard breastfeeding was for me and I still continued to pump & express my breastmilk and bottle feed my child up 7 months. My Dad passed away last year due to cancer, and I didn't really get emotional or practical support from people. I live in a different country than my home country because spouse works here. It's been really hard to manage. 

I do freelance and do my best to show up and work when I can. But many days, taking a shower also feels like a luxury. I have to wait to shower until my spouse returns from work. It's just so hard.

Worse is not one person understands or gets it. All say deal with it. Like how am I supposed to cope with multiple things. Even if spouse helps it's not enough. 

Safe to say, I'm not having any more kids. We are one and done. This is a nightmare for me as is. I have huge mom guilt of not doing enough, I do love my child but I definitely regret having a child, don't think I am cut out for this. 

I always think I could be doing so many amazing things with my life. I get that raising a child is an important job, but it's like I chose the wrong job and am stuck now.

Everything is a fog. I have four children, 11 year-old daughter, 10 year-old son, they were 11 months apart. Five-year-old son with autism, and a 20 month year-old daughter. 

I heard a person on a podcast, not sure which one, talking about how children do make people unhappy in day-to-day life, but in the grand scheme of things you are fulfilled. I seem to agree with that a bit, they do give me a purpose, but I do think I would still have a purpose without them, though. I know I would.

I am unhappy because I cannot run my life properly. I do think I have ADD, but I think with the tools I have learned I could at least be somewhere now if I did not have children or if I only had one.

It took one life situation to just knock out any routine I had developed, and the house got trashed so fast. I feel like I am drowning in a mess, and I crave a clean home. I literally have no time at all. Sometimes my five-year-old wakes up my baby. My five-year-old son with autism Yanks at my arm and pulls me every which way, and he wants to go out 90% of the day. I watch him close and even from inside I cannot do anything because of having to sit by the door.

But… I have to keep reminding myself, all of this is temporary, I can see through this. I must tell myself, and I must believe that I can get my home in order. I must tell myself that yes progress is slow, but every bit of it counts.

I have the packet to register him into school and get the official diagnosis. I am trying to break down tasks by starting with what is not working in my life, and I am trying to give myself reasonable time to achieve certain goals of mine.

But it just seems like each day goes by. Each day goes by, and I fed them and I bathed them. Did I get a shower? I usually can’t.  I just want to feel pretty again, I want to be able to take care of myself. I’m 32 and I’m afraid of aging and I just can’t even get a skin care routine going because I fall asleep every time I nurse my child to sleep.

I crave a routine, but I also crave adventure. 

And here’s the end, and I will share with you a little story that I remind myself, a little story I was told by somebody several years ago, I will post it into the comments if you interested in hearing something that can help reframe the way you see things.

I wanted to have a daughter all my life and now i finally do. She is healthy and i gave birth to her quickly. I was afraid of childbirth because i heard that it’s painful especially when you’re giving birth for the first time. But she was fast. I was pushing her for 7 minutes. I was lucky it wasn’t traumatic and long. It felt surreal. It still is. But here she is. In the crib. Sleeping. Yet i don’t feel it. I don’t feel the connection i was supposed to feel when i held her for the first time. The feeling i was longing for. It feels like i am watching over someone else’s baby. I don’t know if i love her. My husband surely does. He is so happy and is adapting to fatherhood. Most of the time when she is crying at night he initiates to take care of her. But it’s hard to fall back asleep after hearing baby cries. 

Every time she cries i am like “Ugh what is she crying for again?”. I don’t hate her. I don’t want to leave her and run away because now i have responsibility. She is my top priority. I promised myself not to be like my mom but here i am. My mom loved me when i was little but when dad started bringing his mistresses home she started blaming me for ruining her marriage. She blamed me for ruining her body. When i got older and knew what sex is she blamed me for her low sex drive that lead to my dad cheating. She wanted me to make their life better but instead i brought new side of my parents. My mom wasn’t happy when she found out i was pregnant. She tells me that now i will see how kids destroy lives. 

I keep low contact with my mother. I don’t have the heart to go no contact. She only has me and we barely talk. When we do it’s always her complaining or criticising.

My childhood was only filled with trauma. There wasn't love or comfort or a want for me. I was just this thing they had to keep sort of alive. And sort of they did great at. 

 Me going off and searching love else where was almost like a give in. It was inevitable with the parents I had. So there the bundle of joy is at 16. A baby raising a baby. 

  Well me and the dad didn't work out (of course). He stayed around and parented as much if not more than I did. Which I counted myself lucky for. 

 Years later at 17 I found a new love. 18 engaged and he convinced me to keep the fetus I planned to abort. Telling me he's going to be the best dad and partner ever. I was 18.. of course I believed him. 

 So by 18 I had my son and daughter. My sons dad had put me through hell my whole pregnancy and when my baby came I could barely look at him. 6 months of just keeping him fed and changed. No feelings, no desire to be this things mother. 

 By 6 months those feelings had subsided and I clung to my kids. Relying on happiness through them. As long as they are happy I was happy. 

 I'm 23 now. I love my kids. I think. I have a hard time with the concept of love. I'm overall pretty strict. Their dads are the relaxed weekend type of dads. Anything goes, candy, not brushing teeth (you get what I mean). They're fully involved but maybe I'm not? 

 I'm mentally absent. I mean I'm there and I listen and I wipe tears, make meals play(not as much as I should). I prepare them for life. Teaching my 7 year old how to take care of herself prepare meals, be a good person, friend and empathetic to people.

 Here I am though. 23, so many years of trauma I have BPD and PTSD currently. Married at 19 . Fully traumatized.

 I don't like being a mom. I mourn and mourn and feel like I want to crawl out of my skin because I feel like I'm living someone else's life. I sit and daydream about running away but I can't physically ever do it. I dream about being single. 

 Im not excusing any decision I have made or even continue to make. My kids will always be something I think of first. My husband is someone I'll probably never leave. However I wonder time and time again what my life would have been life if my parents really loved me.",Likely mother: 6 > 1

I love my family - but I absolutely loathe the role of being a mum with every fibre of my being. 

I have a good rewarding job which I love and work part time. My husband is the bread winner and works long hours but despite this is more hands on than most dads I know so I can't complain in that department - he is incredible - and the reason why I went along with having a child in the first place, despite never wanting them. 

Here we are 4 years later and I wake up on weekends and my 'days off' absolutely dreading the day ahead. The constant 'I want this and I'm hungry' (she eats more than I do!). The constant draining chatter ALL DAY LONG and the god awful meltdowns (last night she had one because after wetting herself she wanted her wet knickers back on. FULL ON screaming, hitting her head, rocking back and forth - yes she is awaiting an EHCP assessment for likely autism)

I wake up and look around the house in disgust at the mess and grime that I'll spend all day cleaning only to be messed up and spilt on within an hour. I even find my dog irritating which I never used to. 

I often find myself on Rightmove looking at 1 bed flats and fantasising about having my own space, or having a steamy affair or running away with a hot guy to an exotic country - all of which makes me feel super guilty 

I'm bored, fed up and yes probably depressed (on anti depressants already)

I love my family and know it would break them if I left - and it would break me too! I just feel so overwhelmed (fyi I'm autistic too)",Likely mother: 2 > 0

I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

Today is Saturday. I've been awake since 6am listening to my eldest child sneezing for an hour. Not his fault but it makes me irrationally irritated. Then both kids appear at my bedroom door at 7am. They don't get up that early on a school day. I have to hassle them out of bed, yet there they are up and ready to piss me off on the weekend. It might be selfish but I hate this. It is not joyful. It is relentlessly shit. I want so badly to undo it all. I don't know how to reframe this in my mind and try to glean some joy out of it when all I want to do is stay under my duvet forever.

I get this is normal 3 year old behavior to an extent but he is also super sensitive and has some issues. It's so difficult all day long. He doesn't eat and has sensory issues. I've spent thousands on therapy to get nowhere. I'm avoiding potty training because I think it will be an absolute nightmare. I have to let him watch TV half the day otherwise I'm being screamed at all day - he only acts like this around me. Is my only solution to return to work so I can use that money to pay for daycare or full time preschool? I literally don't know what else to do because I'm going insane. My partner works all the time so he only helps with like 5% of kid related things which is probably why I'm also struggling. On top of that I have a 6 month old who is now super needy and also needs me all day long - although he is MUCH easier than the 3 year old. Forget any time for myself or to even to leave the house more than once a week- that went out the window when I had my second. I feel like my life is over right now and cry every single day.

Seriously the sun shines out of his a-s to me, but I hate my life now. I hate pumping. I get nauseated everytime I pump for the first ten minutes, but of course I the second I get over that the baby starts screaming or the dog needs to go out and I have to stop pumping to take care of them then restart the process. I hate never getting enough sleep. I hate how it’s ruining my relationship because my partner, while amazing, never seems to understand what I need even if I’m literally telling him exactly what it is. I hate having to explain why I need help. If I'm telling you ""I need to go to take the baby for a minute."" It shouldn't require me to answer six different questions. Take the freaking baby. I can’t do anything I love anymore. I can’t read any of my books. I can’t do my art which I was becoming known for. It's completely torpedoed my art business because I can't focus on it at all. I can't even do passion projects. I almost screamed at my MIL(out of my own frustration, not her being malicious) when she started to tell me someone else came into my area to teach classes when I had to stop because of the baby. I just swallowed it like a bullet and nodded when I just wanted to smash every dish in my cupboard over it. I can’t just sit quietly in a room by myself without someone demanding my time and attention whether it be the baby, pets, or my husband that insists on being the loudest person in the room. Everytime he does anything with the baby he is so loud and constantly looking over at me as if for my approval and it just feels so performative everytime while I’m doing 95% of the work. He's the one that wanted the baby, but I feel like I'm always the one who has to pick up the slack for everything. 
I hate feeling like this because he is such a joy, but I want to be able to enjoy it and not feel resentful. I want at least 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I want to take private time to work on my art and feel like my own person again.",Likely mother: 2 > 0

My girl is 3mo, health, smiling, babbling but when she's fussy, there's no cure. She fusses on forever and make me wonder if she inherited my temperament. I don't feel ready. I admit that my mom pressured me into this. She called me selfish, different names and I saw other women having kids and thought it's cute and I could manage.

We have no help from either side of the family. Even worse, his mom has anxiety and OCD. The son must physically go to her home in a different state to be a good son. She keeps telling my husband that baby care is easy. Just let the baby cry and go to bed and feed when you wake up and have energy. I keep getting injuries from childcare because I'm tiny and she's growing. He still fucking needs to visit her and leave me caring for a baby alone. He's like ""you don't even need to go to work"". 

He used to be the best boyfriend, husband, everything. He still cleans and cooks. But I'm miserable. He only helps a couple hours after work. He demands me to get a night nanny so we can sleep, it costs thousands per month. He wants to watch TV, play video games and wants to go out to eat even more claiming he doesn't have mercy for dishes. I have fallen from a happy wife status to a miserable mom that complains and crys often. Wtf!

My parents are fucking useless. My dad is always on his phone and he left the family to do soul search for a decade. My mom got into herbal tea and said she must have the baby drink it. She will force it down her throat when I'm not looking if I don't allow it. 

His dad is also a phone addict. Never helped when I was bleeding and dragging my body postpartum. Always on his bed. His mom cooked only because she enjoyed my SIL's companionship and asked my husband to take her shopping and have a meal outside, leaving me, injured taking care of a newborn alone at home Christmas day.",Likely mother: 5 > 2
21 March 2025,I regret adopting my nieces from foster care.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jgppnr/i_regret_adopting_my_nieces_from_foster_care/,"I’ll preface by saying that I love them and don’t regret getting them out of the foster care system, but they have such high needs that it’s maddening. I take all three of them (5, 6, and 12) to therapy every week, one goes to speech therapy every week, and one goes to the psychiatrist once a month. Also IEP meetings like every other month to track progress.

They cannot follow instructions at all and have developmental issues that results in them being able to hardly do anything without specific direction. The oldest has autism and the younger two have ADHD. I could tell them “put on your glasses” and it’s like they completely ignore it. None of them are even close to grade level in school.

I have no family in my state to use for child care, and those who are here are addicts. The problem is that I am completely overstimulated all the time, which results in me getting snappy or yelling. I hate feeling irritated and annoyed all the time, but I also hate taking out my anger on them. Even when I tell them I need alone time and lock myself in my room, they won’t leave and talk to me through the door. I’ve never spanked them or anything like that, but admittedly I have yelled at them pretty intensely. They have no respect for me whatsoever, and we have been to and are currently going to family therapy. I’ve also done individual therapy.

Their schools and daycare are good supports to us, and I find myself leaving them at daycare until as late as possible.

I feel so alone with these feelings. I want the best for them obviously and am not ever giving up on them, but I hate my life now. I am constantly miserable. I’m open to suggestions or just hearing anyone who can empathize.

21 March 2025,Unrealistic advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jgp3a6/unrealistic_advice/,"I feel like in a lot of groups focusing around parenting or in general, babies, there’s a lot of unrealistic advice. My son (first & only child) is 7 weeks old today. He’s gotten to the point of where he’s inconsolable unless he’s being held.

Everyone says “Well yeah, he lived 9 months inside you. He needs warmth and the heartbeat is comforting. He needs to be held.” 

This baby will NOT for the life of him, sleep or be calm unless he’s being held. Calm and soothe him and then put him in a bassinet, swing, ANYTHING that isn’t a human…. Screaming… We’ve tried pacifiers, expensive rocking bassinets, expensive rocking swings, noise makers, swaddling, making sure he’s at a good temperature, fed and burped prior to being placed down. It’s ridiculous at this point… The first month my husband and I essentially didn’t work. We worked very minimal hours so he did get held a lot. Now that we are both working full time, however my work is from home, however a physically demanding job as I work with animals. My MIL had to move in to care for the baby because he just can’t be separated. 

Everyone tells me “just use a baby carrier and carry him on you when you’re working during the day.” You’re going to tell me, for my entire day I need to have this baby strapped to my chest? Again, I work with animals so not every waking moment of my job is safe to have a baby strapped to me. I did figure going into this, I would be able to utilize a baby monitor for an hour or so during those times of work where having a baby strapped to my chest wouldn’t be safe or ideal… I also have degenerative disc disease and my back is extremely fucked from a major injury years ago. I can’t physically carry this baby even in a hands free carrier all day even if I wanted. My back would NEVER allow it. Still, everyone tells me that if the baby wants to be held and be close/skin to skin, that’s what I should do. 

Luckily my MIL moved in so I could continue working and doing my career. That’s the last part of me I seem to have left anymore that reminds me, I am ME and I am more than just a mom…

It just feels unrealistic to basically be this babies human bassinet… I do get that there’s a comforting aspect to it, but it’s got to be unrealistic to be holding the baby 24 hours a day. Literally the only time this baby isn’t held is when his diaper and clothes are being changed and holy shit… You would think he’s being abused with how he screams. I can’t wait until this baby turns 4 months old because we will most certainly be sleep training and working on being able to cope without being constantly held. 

Any advice would be great. I’ve mentioned this to the pediatrician too asking maybe he needs an adjustment from a chiropractor since he was yanked out of my body due to shoulder dystocia, or maybe he struggles with gas as his stomach is quite tight and he grunts a lot, despite doing gripe water and constantly trying to help him move gas around. He also spits up a lot so I thought maybe reflux as well? All these things I was told no. No advice, no referrals, no medications, nothing. Was just told “Well that’s what baby’s do. He wants and needs to just be held right now. Babies do this. It just takes patience. It’ll get better.” 

We’ve tried everything… The only thing that seems to be working is him being laid up on someone’s chest… I’m also currently sick with a fever, bad cough, and congestion so it’s out of question that I’ll be holding and breathing on this little one. 

I’m so freaking tired sick of this shit to extremely blunt with you guys… I’m sick of the unrealistic advice. I’m sick of the cookie cutter responses. I’m sick of my family and especially friends who don’t have kids that make passive aggressive comments or cookie cutter advice. I’m just over it.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

In sticky situation, 30M got a single mom pregnant. We were in a relationship for 5 months and then she got pregnant both our fault and both decided to keep him hes 5 months old now.

She has a daugther from an ex she's 7, the baby dad does the bare minimum pays child support but anything extra expenses falls on the mom like new clothes, shoes, after school club etc.

Now i'm in a pickle she expects me to now foot all the bills and pay for everything that concerns her daughter & my child as i'm the ""man"". She expects me to provide a deposit for future home etc. Now i understand that dynamic is traditional and if we were married i'd understand but i've been with her 5 months before she got pregnant. I haven't made her my wife, i hadn't even moved in with her only did just before the baby arrived.

I feel like it's not fair maybe i'm right or wrong, her ex is a POS does the bare minimum she's struggled for 7 years instead of her to direct her frustration at him and ask for more she said she's given up as he won't do it. She's directing it at me as if i should save her etc, now i get it some men take on other peoples kids and we was in a relationship. But i'd expect such expectations to come after we've atleast lived together, got married, planned to have a child. Our situation is not like that.

It's causing alot of problems, she wants to break up as ""deserves"" a man that provides, but i don't think it's entirely fair to expect that of me. I have saved around 40k and she has 0 savings, she said she couldn't save as a solo parent. But i don't think thats true, i'm not saying save half your paycheck but prior to her pregnancy she used to always go shopping eat out etc, so i was suggesting she could have saved maybe 100$ a month so she could buy a home in future. If she saved that much for 7 years she'd have almost 10k easy. So there's no excuse for me why she has no savings it's just bad financial planning.

Basically it seems like me as the step dad i'm expected to be superman, you have 0 accountability for not financially planning. Now i'm here i'm meant to buy us this house etc pay all the bills etc with someone i'm not married to. Should i be doing this? She's obviously looking after the kids so can't work extra hours and is on maternity pay. I don't expect her to have saved SINCE she got pregnant but surely i'm not wrong in saying she should have planned better for the future?",Likely father: 5 > 3
20 March 2025,I don’t think I can ever forgive my mom for forcing me to give birth at 15,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jfi0ye/i_dont_think_i_can_ever_forgive_my_mom_for/,"I founded out I was pregnant at 15 years old. I wanted an abortion but where I’m from you have to have parental consent to terminate a pregnancy if you’re a minor. My mom didn’t allow this to happen even after multiple conversations and times of asking her and she was even “excited” and happy for me. I was so hurt for the longest by this but I had to just suck it up and accept the outcome that I was given. I was considering putting my child up for foster care but done my own research on the system and realized I don’t have the heart to do that. I will raise her and sacrifice my childhood for my baby who didn’t ask to be here. But it’s so hard many days. I get so stressed out daily, I struggle with depression and anxiety and started resorting to smoking weed to cope. And even years later, it’s so hard to not feel resentment and anger towards my mom. Don’t get me wrong, I do love my child and have accepted that I am a parent now and this is my responsibility, but on top of college, my relationship with her dad, and dealing with the toddler phase where they throw tantrums a lot, it’s hard and stressful. My mom barely helps at all with my child too. Don’t get me wrong, I 100% acknowledge that she’s not obligated to take care of my child. However, when it came to my other siblings she was always there with their kids, but when I ask her for help so I can do an exam while my partner is at work, I can tell she’s annoyed and upset by the question and I can’t help but think “how are you going to force me to give birth to a child and you’re not even going to help?”


Im very stressed all the time. I speed ran through my school work and graduated at 16 which is a good thing but it was extremely difficult and not easy. I’m trying to finish college up now faster, planning on getting married with my daughter’s father, and have a whole place and everything. But I’m only 18 years old. I’m so extremely young but I feel like I have to do this for my kid. I worked a lot, I grew up extremely fast. I feel a loss of my childhood and feel so grown up even though I still see a child in the mirror. And social media doesn’t make me feel any better. I see on TikTok of people talking about teen moms a lot saying that we are “stupid” for not getting an abortion when we founded out we were pregnant and I get sad and think “well I wanted to terminate my pregnancy, I had no choice” it makes me feel really shitty and I truly hate my mom for the decision she’s made for me. People truly don’t understand my situation and don’t get that I didn’t want this initially, but I literally had no choice. 

And to address the elephant in the room. Yes, I take full accountability on WHY I gotten pregnant. That wasn’t my mom’s fault or anything like that. However, keeping the pregnancy and raising it wasn’t. And no matter how hard I try to just accept my life the way it is especially since I can’t go back. But it just makes me cry. Sometimes I feel like my mom set me up. Knowing the statistics and outcomes that occur from children being born to teen mothers, feeling like another statistic as teen pregnancy was generational in my family and more. I just feel hurt and resentment. I love my child to death. But I wasn’t ready when I had her, and I feel so guilty and shitty. And I hate that my mom didn’t care for my opinions or well being at all and only thought of her self. All I know is that I will never force my child to give birth when they are a child themselves. Never ever. I hope one day these feelings can go away and I can just find peace with myself and the situation.",Likely mother: 7 > 0

If you feel like you could have some neurodivergency and want to know if diagnosis and meds was worth it. A thousand times, yes. It made so much difference to me.

- sleep. More sleep. I cannot help you in how to achieve this goal. My son only unlocked better sleep after his 2nd birthday. Made me a better and more relaxed parent.

- finding a trustworthy babysitter and going on date nights at least once a month.

- work. I thought I would be fine staying home with my little one until he was 2, but starting work when he was 10 months helped me. I felt so stuck at home and desperately needed to feel like not just a mom but a full human.

- time to build relationship with kiddo. The bond doesn't happen overnight and that's okay. Society's expectation of instant bonding is ridiculous.

- only having one child. I think it's why I stopped feeling regretful recently. Because the worst baby phase and the overstimulation is getting less and less and I don't have to do it again. Also, not someone's who can juggle well",Unclear: 0 / 0

For the kind people who commented on it and gave advice, I thought long and hard on every suggestion. This is the conclusion. 

After sitting down and having a long discussion with my parents and both of my grandson’s parents it’s been decided that he will go to Louisiana with my mom and dad. They are a better fit for an active 4 year old than me, what with my arthritic self trying to hobble around after him. 

They all four signed a notarized document allowing my parents to make decisions regarding his care but it’s not yet a legal custody agreement. We are going to revisit my state of health in the future before we make permanent decisions. I was only diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis about 7 months ago so it’s quite possible that with the right med combination I can be capable of caring for him in the future. Right now my health is in the gutter, I would give a lot to have my pain-free healthy body back instead of being cursed with this terrible painful disease. 

They are going back to Louisiana, 11 hours away, this morning and I cried my eyes out all night, already missing my little guy and feeling like such a failure but I know it’s best for him, it’s not about my feelings. They do visit us here in Tennessee often, at least every few months so it’s not like I’ll go long periods of time without seeing him, and they are currently making plans to move back up here. 

I’ve just been so stressed out about this whole situation, among many other stresses not related so it’s almost too much to handle. My mental health is also in the gutter. My son is in the Navy and is currently out on deployment and that’s a constant worry for me. Whenever he’s out with the fleet communication is very limited, if at all. I haven’t had a chance to clean my house properly with a 4 year old in residence so that’s something else that needs done. It’s driving me nuts because I’m a clean freak but I just can’t find the motivation to do it, not to mention my knees aren’t cooperating today.

My fiance was at work, she had a late shift(her sporadic retail schedule has been detrimental to our lifestyle and family's well being, but that's neither here nor there) anyway, she got off at 9 PM tonight, okay, fine, it is what it is.

Throughout the day, I figured, hey, we don't really ever get to enjoy each other's company and haven't for over 14 months (since before the baby was born) so I say ""alright, self, the place got a bit messy over the past week(everyone was sick), so, let's get the place super clean and figure out a dinner that she'll really like.""

So, I spend the entire day absolutely busting my hide to get the place clean, meticulously plan the entire day's schedule, baby's nap times, baby's meals, baby's bath, baby's bed time, a trip to the grocery store etc down to the very minute in order to make it so I could have dinner just about done so, she could go shower after work and come downstairs to a freshly cooked dinner in a spotless house with candles, and the whole shebang.

Well, my toddler had seemingly every desire to do everything in her power to absolutely demolish any chance I had to have ONE evening where I could just feel like a normal, consenting adult with my fiance, one evening to just feel normal and have the TINIEST shred of autonomy. Despite that, i tried to stay positive, and just worked harder, she was absolutely miserable today, like abnormally so, but I held in there, I've not felt any sort of actual happiness or comfort since becoming a parent, so, I was determined. So, it's starting to get to be that time, so, I get all the food prepped, clean up the living room for a 6th time, kid ate a meal i whipped up for just her at 6, as to not disrupt her schedule, and now it's time to get the kiddo ready for bed.

The moment she realizes I'm taking her up to bed, she naturally starts wailing, which is what ever, no biggy, she usually chills out once I play the country song I sing for her every nap/bed time. Not this time, though. She may have stopped losing her mind, sure, but instead she starts sticking her tongue in and out, in and out, in and out, over and over and over, and the reason she does this? To keep herself from falling asleep, I rocked this kid for 40 minutes, until finally I get a text from my fiance, the door is locked and she left her keys at home. Turns out, our one flat mate decided that tonight was the gonna be the literal first time in four years he had the sense to lock the fucking door. At that point everything boiled to a head, I exploded, the sad and disgusting reality of the fact that i will never, ever have control over my own life again came crashing down on me. I'm done. Like, i give up, it's taking everything I have to not get on the first flight to a far off land and start anew.

My fiance told me she totally understands why I'm so upset after seeing everything that i tried to set up today and told me she appreciates it and that it's the thought that counts, she meant it as a reassurance and a comfort, which means alot in and of itself, but it did the opposite of reassure me. To me that just sounded like ""Buckle up for a life time of 'it's the thought that counts.""

This is something that I've (if it isn't obvious) have been really wrestling with the past year, I come from a VERY controlling family and fought tooth and nail to get my own agency in life, and just like that, poof, all gone, back to having zero say in how my life goes, no right to decide what's best for me. Then, throw on the fact that what used to be a really fulfilling and exciting relationship has turned into a laughable roommate situation.<===(Through no fault of my partner, for the record)  
\---Is it showing that I'm literally ingulfed in my biggest fear in life? A total loss of autonomy?

Anyway, sorry for the long article, I'm just feeling so explosive right now and needed a place to word vomit with no filter or this would come with me tomorrow. Thanks for anyone who took the time to read, if any.

All I wanted was to feel normal again and I worked SO hard for the smallest slice of that and it's like the whole world was collaborating to make it blow up in my face and show me how foolish I was to even dream up such a ridiculous notion ""You're a parent, you don't get to have anymore joy or self-indulgence, idiot""...

I mean being a 24/7 parent SUCKS, but i imagine seeing my kid(4months) on weekends only will be a nice balance. I won't miss him, so not seeing him will be fine in fact i may enjoy seeing him as absence makes the heart grow fonder perhaps. Perhaps i'll enjoy being a dad if i have an OFF button, e.g. dad on weekends, me on weekdays.

It's the off button that is non negotiable, i have no desire to be a husband or a full time dad, i need to be able to turn off. Atm i get 0 time to myself, money is all spent on the baby, no love life, just stress and worry. When i'll be coparenting ill atleast have me time, more money for me etc and just silence.

When I was a child, my parents never really entertained or played with me — and they seemed fine with it. We lived on five acres, my dad was away for work three-quarters of the year, and there were three of us boys to keep each other company.

These days, it feels like a lot of parents resent parenting because we don’t have the same support systems. Many of us don’t have a village to help raise our kids — no nearby family, and often not even friends who come to visit.

Are we exhausted and sometimes frustrated with parenting because of how involved we have to be with our kids? It feels like we’re attached at the hip, and if we try to step back even a little, there’s always a judgmental neighbor ready to criticize.

For example, as I write this, my two-year-old is hanging off my neck while watching Cars.

I wonder if we wouldn’t feel this way if we were less involved, like our parents were. Maybe we feel this way because we care so much and are trying hard to do right by our kids.

Looking back, I just can’t believe how naive I was… I would see a mom and her baby at my job and be like “awwwww omg they are so cute, you must be head over heels” now I think about how my comments could have been triggering to those moms who could have been struggling with ppd or depression and all I think about was how cute their baby was.

He refused to eat his morning mash or let me brush his teeth. I tried to carry him but he just screamed. Finally my wife woke up and he seemed just fine. Somehow she is enjoying this life but I don't in the slightest. Worst of all, she wants a second child and puts me in an awkward position.

I just feel so empty inside. I got a boring job which I despise which I have to do in order to provide for my family. I used to have ideals and passions. Compared with this mindless family life of routine walks, grocery shopping etc. it just sucks out all my life juices. I don't look forward to anything anymore. I have visions of escaping to nature and leaving all this behind. I'm spending my best years in life stuck in a always messy apartment instead of being out there and exploring the world. Every day is the same experience. I don't grow, I decline. I'm always restless and brooding with no clear purpose. I have no connection with my child. I give him all I can but he is still a stranger most of the times.

Don't get me wrong. I don't blame the child and support my family to the best of my ability. I just find modern living in isolated household compared to our hunter & gatherer past in big communites with help unnatural.

16 March 2025,Unfortunately now having to raise my grandson.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jcljrr/unfortunately_now_having_to_raise_my_grandson/,"Edit to add that I thought I would receive support and compassion instead of being ridiculed for both my daughter and I being teen mothers. It makes me a bit sad and disillusioned that I cannot share my story here without unnecessary and unhelpful comments. For the supportive comments, thank you. 

So I’ve posted on here several times previously about how much I disliked being a mother and couldn’t wait until my two children were grown and my life was my own again. Then my daughter became a teen mother and was adamant about keeping him. I’ve always been hands-on when it came to helping her but I made it clear that I was NOT his mother. 

He is 4 now and she had been doing ok on her own until recently. She had her own apartment, a job, and was still with his father until about a year ago. I was aware that she had been struggling with being a single mom so I took him more and more often, sometimes for days at a time. Maybe she enjoyed her child-free time so much that she decided she didn’t want to be a full-time mother anymore? She ended up quitting her job, let her apartment go, and moved in with a new boyfriend and they don’t “have room” for a kid in his place. I personally think her new bf just doesn’t want a kid around although she denies it. 

She came to me and asked me to take him, as in like permanently raising him. I feel as though I didn’t have a choice, she obviously doesn’t want to do it anymore and I don’t want him around her bf anyway. His dad isn’t really fit to raise him alone either, to be perfectly honest. 

My main issue currently is my health. I was positively diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis back in the fall after suffering years of symptoms. It affects nearly every joint in my body and can be excruciatingly painful sometimes. I’m getting treatment for it, including injections that suppress my immune system so it’s not ideal for me to constantly be around a young child that’s getting ready to start kindergarten in the fall. I still suffer from daily pain, my condition is nowhere near under control yet and it could take months to find the right med combination. 

Some days I can barely walk and it’s difficult to do daily tasks caring for a child…for example it’s torture on my back and hands to bathe him (I have to bend over because kneeling is out of the question with my knees swollen to the size of baseballs) and my hands make it painful and difficult to dress him, I can’t take him anywhere by myself because my hands are so bad that I can’t buckle and unbuckle his car seat. 

He’s had his own room here for a while now so space isn’t a problem, and we can financially afford to raise him. He’s genuinely a good kid, he minds well and is a sweetheart, very loving and cuddly. I love him with my whole heart. But for fuck’s sweet sake, I did not sign up for this. I do not want this responsibility for the next 15 years. I’m so angry at my daughter I told her she best not come around for a while because I’d be tempted to throat punch her for putting me in this situation. 

I know this is getting too long but there is one other option available to me. My parents have offered to take him. I’m very unsure about this because I feel that he’s my grandson so therefore more my responsibility than theirs. My parents are still relatively young, not yet in their sixties. I don’t feel that it’s fair to them to take on a preschooler when they’re approaching retirement age. They also live in Louisiana while I’m in Tennessee, although they are planning on moving back up here by next year. I don’t know what to do but I’m so overwhelmed, both mentally and physically.",Likely mother: 5 > 1

15 March 2025,Tubal Ligation After 1 Baby,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jbm1ys/tubal_ligation_after_1_baby/,"For women who have only had 1 baby, have you had any push back from doctors when it comes to wanting a tubal ligation? Have you had your doctor deny you or want permission from your husband to ensure it's under a mutual agreement? Did you feel you had to convince your doctor that you knew for sure you were done having children? 

I'm 26 years old and had my first baby the first month of this year. I hated pregnancy and I hate motherhood even more. I know for a fact I absolutely do not want more children. I don't want to put myself or my body through pregnancy, birth, or going through raising a baby ever again. I don't need hormones or society tricking me into thinking that ""just one more"" couldn't hurt. I was already fell for it once... I so badly wish that I just would've listened to younger me... Younger me who told me that being a mom wasn't for me and knowing myself confidently enough back then to know that I would hate this... Then of course those hormones hit with age and I got into a healthy relationship/marriage and thought that having a family would be grand because I mean, that's what society and my body are telling me right? WRONG! I don't need anyone trying to convince me to have another baby... 

My husband and my mother in law are already talking about another future child and honestly, I want to run away from the one I already have so bringing another one into this world doesn't sound right or fair. Both of these people have been godsend for being my little village helping me with this baby. They do 90% of it all. They both know I'm struggling and are just hoping that something will change and that all the help they provide will eventually help me bond because they're trying their best to alleviate any stress. 

The thing is, is that it's so much more than just the baby... It was how pregnancy limited me, how I hate my body now and am left with permanent marks, my body doesn't even feel like my own or one that I know. It's how birth has permanently left me with PTSD from a traumatic experience due to complications... It's how now the only identity I have in public is being just a mom when I am so much more than that... I'm ME. 

I just want to have a tubal ligation. Have it done and be over with it. Then tell my family later. Basically like a do it now, ask for forgiveness later type of thing. Yeah, it may be wrong. But it's my body, it's my health both physically and mentally, this is my autonomy. Could it end my marriage? Sure. He can take the baby and leave. Maybe he would find someone else who can actually handle motherhood and love it! I love my husband a ton. He's perfect in every way, except for the fact that he wants a large family and I now have changed my mind after my experience... Honestly, it may be a huge reason why we don't make it to forever.

Every single day that it's non stop screaming or crying from the moment we wake up or until bedtime, or even the days where everyone is happy and  everything went right... I am still thinking in the back of my head, I want to leave. I look at my kids smiling faces while they hug me and I still... I know this is all going away tomorrow. It'll be chaotic and just.... to much tomorrow....

I've been in a relationship for 10 years, haven't married yet. We have 3 kids. 8yr old, 2 yr, 1 yr. 
&& this regretful thoughts has been with me since my first born 8 years ago. 

My 2 yr old has been nonstop chaos, bouncing off the walls and doesn't get along with his older sister 8yr. My 1 yr old is a Lil sweetheart but she's starting to copy what her 2yr old brother does. And now ..... I don't know what to do. 

I've tried every parent technique, changed my tone, tried to discipline differently and it all just revert back to constantly yelling and spanking.... I'm at a loss at parenting them... && idk what to do... 

My relationship has been pretty steady and he's a really good father. But we've had issues in the past and I can't seem to shake the idea, "" I would be happier if I just left and we coparent"". I love him, I truly do. But this constant stress, anxiety and depression with the kids, outweighs that. ...

I have no money of my own, no college degree, no place to go, and have no idea what I could possibly do if I left... 

Even if Noone reads this or comments..that's okay because I finally wrote this down and finally feel like I can try to come to terms that this is how I really feel... it's insane to even admit it to my self but after reading alot of the posts of this subreddit, that pushed me to just"" f**k it"", I need to let it out....",Unclear: 0 / 0

However, I am wondering if anyone here has met or spoke with parents in person who regret their choice to have children. I have… i remember speaking with one of my co workers over a year ago when I found out that I was pregnant. She was about 3 years older than I was but she had her son at fairly young age (21 years old). I was contemplating having a baby because I was scared that the responsibility would be to much. I was still early enough to get an abortion, but I was still weighing all my options. She told me that she wished she had not listened to her family and aborted her son. I was shocked but ofc I reacted without judgement. At the time, her son was 3 years old and she flat out told me that she wished she had went through with the procedure to terminate the pregnancy. In my head, I was thinking that if she feels this way 3 years in, then there must be something I dont understand about the truths of motherhood. I listened to my co worker/ friend and got a DNC the NEXT DAY. Fast forward months later and I found out I was pregnant, again (after my BC failed). I thought that the universe was trying to show me some sort of lesson/ blessing so I ended up giving birth to my daughter last June. Now I am completely miserable!! Sorry for the long post but I am curious to know if anyone has come across a parent (in person) that regrets having kids.

I have one child, who is now almost 40.  Despite everyone telling me that motherhood was grand, glorious and fulfilling, I found it exhausting drudgery.  Yes, I was fortunate to have a normal child, although she really didn't sleep much the first year.  Having a child ended up destroying my marriage.  We just could not change.  My husband always expected everything to go back to ""normal"" (pre-child).  The burdens always fell on me.  

Almost 40 years later, I managed to raise a reasonably well-adjusted young woman, now married with her own children, and we have a good relationship!  She lives on another continent but we visit about every year.  She's cool.  

But wow I could have done without the entire childhood rearing experience.  My older sister says she regrets not having kids and I told her to stop that thought right now.  She might have ended up with a miserable situation, and might have gotten lucky, but it's a 50/50 deal at best.

I have previously made a post about my deep regret for having a baby at 23 years old (which feels so young to have such a huge responsibility). My daughter is beautiful, cute and I love her but I have never hated my life more. Every day is the same, yo. We go from the changing pad to the swing then some tummy time (with toys) bottle nap and REPEAT. Literally this is a different kind of boring because it is tiring at the same time. I would love to go outside but it’s too cold for her to be out in my state. Even still she would just be pushed around in a stroller by a tired mom who wished nothing more than to get some sleep without interruption. And I don’t have a reliable partner to pass her off to for a little so it leaves me stuck in this endless cycle of mindless baby babbling and boredom. I can’t help but think of all the other things I would like to do with my life right now besides being the default parent. If anyone has any suggestions on what to do with a baby all day I am so open to suggestions ( but no judgement tho). Has anyone else ever felt this way? It feels like there is no getting away from this endless cycle. I can’t put her daycare yet bc I told myself I would wait until she is a year old.

10 March 2025,Regret is not an illness,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1j7uvu5/regret_is_not_an_illness/,"If you have the nerve to tell anyone you feel regretful about having  kids, it’s likely they will tell you to seek help. Therapy and antidepressants are the cure-all, because there must be something wrong with you on a neurological level. Your feelings are the result of a mental illness, you have a medical condition, you must have PPD, your hormones are the problem etc. You’re brave for talking openly about your ”condition”, but don’t ever say you’re regretful.

I’m not saying that therapy and medication won’t make you feel better about your situation. They might, but they might not. In any case, your personal situation and the society around you won’t change. You will still have a lack of support, face financial stress, have no free time, and still be expected to be a good employee, mother, wife/partner. If the medication works, everything just feels dulled down. If the therapy works, you know in the back of your mind that you’ve “tricked” yourself into feeling better.

You don’t have an illness. Your feelings are a natural and reasonable response to the stress of your everyday lived experience. I’m tired of people saying that parental regret and depression is just a neuro-chemical problem, as if the bullshit we have to put up with everyday has nothing to do with how we feel. I’m tired of people seeing depression and regret as a problem that exists in the individual, rather than something that is a symptom of a society that doesn’t look after parents.",Likely mother: 1 > 0

I ofc want to start out by saying that I love my daughter very much, she is the cutest thing I have ever seen. But unfortunately cuteness is not worth the loss of freedom and happiness that I am currently experiencing. I do not have any support, my boyfriend is not involved at all. He doesn’t want to look after her for more than 30 mins so I am constantly relying on my mother to watch her so I can get some time to myself. I have no job, no motivation, no energy and $.37 in my bank account. I used to love my job and seeing my friends/ coworkers but now everyday is like Groundhog Day. I never get a break, I never feel rested and all of my energy is focused on my daughter. I am so tired of making/ cleaning bottles, playing w annoying lil baby toys, and watching Peppa Pig. Why does no one talk about how miserable motherhood truly is. I am definitely a one and done mom. Everyday is tough. I miss waking up and playing music and getting ready to start my day without having to care for someone else 24/7. The days are LONG and in my state it is very cold so I can’t exactly take my baby outside for fresh air all the time. Sorry not sorry for the long post bc I really needed to vent. My life is over and I feel it every second of every day. I had her when I was 23 thinking that being a young mom would be “cute” and “manageable”. I feel into the trap that society tells you about motherhood but it is all lies. This is the most depressed and sad I have ever felt and it never goes away.

I got a comment on one of my posts that changed my perspective. Ok yeah i do hate being a dad but wallowing in self pity and posting daily about how much i hate my life is not going to help. I might aswell find a way to find joy in this new life of mine, go gym, get theraphy and maybe it will get better.

Maybe it wont but i can atleast try, this is a great forum btw i actually love how parents use it to vent and suppprt eachother etc. Ive just been using it the wrong way and albeit too much.

I noticed a lot of grammar mistakes with the original post, but it wouldn’t let me edit it for some reason, so I’m reposting) 

Made this account just to rant. I’m 23F and bisexual. I had one child at 18 and another at 20 because I’m an idiot who firmly believed she was in love with the man she was with at the time. so I have a 5 year old son and a 3 year old daughter. My ex and I share custody of them but even the 50% of time that I see them isn’t a long enough break. He’s a terrible influence on them, and no matter how hard I try to correct the behavior he teaches them, they just learn it all again the next time they see him. He’s made them unruly brats, especially my son. My daughter at least has some redeeming qualities- she’s very smart (which she used to her advantage all the time) and sometimes she will obey me without a fight- my son has none. He’s rude, entitled and nasty to his sister and to me. Sometimes I want to try and get full custody of them, just so they don’t turn out to be horrible people as a result of being raised by him, but having them full time just sounds like a nightmare. 

At 21, when my parents graciously offered to watch my kids for the night, I went to a lesbian bar and met this wonderful girl. We hit it off and went on a couple dates. I learned she was child free and she never wanted kids and I feel terrible that I didn’t tell her right away but I really liked her and I didn’t want to scare her away…eventually when things started to feel serious, I knew I had to tell her I had two kids before I seriously hurt her, so I did. I think we sat in silence for thirty minutes after I told her that. She just couldn’t process how we had hung out so much and I never brought up my kids, but it’s just because I don’t like to talk about them. Eventually, she told me that she really liked me and she’d be willing to make it work, even with my kids. I was in shock at how gracious and willing she was, especially because they weren’t even HER kids. I felt guilty for roping her into this because I know how much I hated it, but I liked her so much, I didn’t want to let her go. 

However- it. went. horribly. She was always a sweetheart to my children, but they were terrible to her. Whenever she came over when they were around, she would bring them candy and toys. My daughter would at least acknowledge her sometimes and say thank you but my son would just snatch things from her or ignore her. I tried to correct him several times, and he would apologize but just do it all over again the next time he saw her. I know kids don’t mean to break stuff on purpose most of the time, but I just feel like my kids have it out to squash any source of happiness I have (I’m sure they don’t…I think), because they would break her stuff all the time. My daughter broke a very expensive necklace she brought herself with her own money and she didn’t even flinch. She just said it was okay and she didn’t really like it anyway. I know she was just saying that to make me feel better. I was horrified. 

One time, my son even smacked her on the bottom and then made a very inappropriate hip thrusting gesture. I. Was. Mortified. I wanted to cry right there and then, because I could see how uncomfortable she was and I hated that it was my OWN child that made her feel like that. She was so sweet and gently redirected him. I’m not going to say she has great maternal instincts because I really don’t like that phrase and I know she has no desire to be a mother but at that moment, it felt like she could have been a better mother than me because I immediately started to scream at him- she was the one who asked him where he learned that, and he said his dad’s music videos, which is another huge problem I have. 

She’d been dealing with little things and putting up with them for an entire year until the last thing that solidified the end of our relationship happening a couple weeks ago. She was dropping by my apartment to give me something I had left at hers on the way to the beach with her childhood dog’s ashes. She loved to bring her dog there and she wanted to take her there one more time. She had the ashes in a little container in her purse, which she put on top of my table. She and I turned away from the kids for one second to get water from the kitchen. I don’t even know how my kids reached her purse, but my son managed to knock her entire purse down and the container rolled out. He grabbed it and went into the bathroom. I came out of the kitchen and saw her things were on the floor. I started to pick them up and realize there’s no container with ashes. I hear the toilet flush, and my heart drops. I ran into the bathroom but it was too late. 

My son literally flushed her fucking dead dog’s ashes down the toilet. 

I didn’t even know how to tell her. The look on her face was so devastating and she just left without saying goodbye, not that I blamed her. Days later, she called me and told me we needed to talk. I wasn’t surprised when we met later that day and she told me she was breaking up with me. She told me she didn’t hate my kids or me at all, but she just couldn’t deal with life with kids, and why should she have to? She’s not the one who made the worst decision of her life, I was. It broke my heart because she was genuinely such a good girlfriend to me, and if I never had kids, we might’ve actually had a shot. 

I remember telling my mom and other members of my family why we broke up and most of their reactions were the same. I think they thought it would make me feel better if they painted her as the one in the wrong because they all said something along the lines of not being able to understand why she didn’t just stick it out, and that there are going to be bad times and good times and you can’t just leave when things are rough. It honestly just pissed me off more. Why should she have to force herself to suffer for the rest of her life because of another person’s mistake? I just can’t believe they would rather say it was her fault when she did nothing wrong rather than just admit that my kids are the reason for my relationship not working out. I think it’s so harmful when people try to act like children are innocent angels who can do no wrong, even if it’s unintentional. 

Anyway. That’s all I have to say. I’m just really missing her right now. It’s hard to sleep without her so I’m just scrolling through Reddit, trying to distract myself. Anyone else have stories similar to mine?",Likely mother: 6 > 2
07 March 2025,found out my daughter IS deaf & im struggling with it,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1j59ixl/found_out_my_daughter_is_deaf_im_struggling_with/,"I’m feeling so overwhelmed right now and honestly just need to vent; and maybe get some advice if anyone’s been through something similar.

My daughter will be 2 next month, but developmentally she’s almost the exact same baby she was a year ago. We’ve been in speech therapy every week for almost a year, and seeing a hearing specialist too. After months of waiting and feeling like we were getting nowhere, we finally got answers that my daughter is deaf.

On top of that, they’re also seeing early signs of autism, so now we’re being referred to another specialist next week. It’s just… a lot to process all at once.

I left her abusive father a year and a half ago, moved states with literally nothing, and have been trying to rebuild our life ever since. Now this. It feels like I can’t catch a break.

I struggle with my own mental health, and I’m honestly terrified I won’t be able to handle raising a special needs child. I’ve already started trying to learn sign language, but it feels impossible. It’s going to take me years to become fluent, and meanwhile my daughter has NO way to communicate. She’s already so far behind, and now she’s stuck waiting even longer for me to catch up. It breaks my heart.

And the doctors? Completely useless. They basically said “Your daughter’s deaf — okay, bye!” No resources, no guidance, nothing. Like… is there even a program for this?? Classes for hearing parents raising deaf kids? How am I supposed to figure this out alone when I don’t know anyone who’s been through this?

If anyone has advice, resources, or just words of encouragement — I’d be so grateful. I feel like I’m drowning",Likely mother: 1 > 0
06 March 2025,Trapped in a family I resent,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1j54kb2/trapped_in_a_family_i_resent/,"Me (M25) and my wife (F27) had our first child 8 months ago. We had never been well off, living paycheck to paycheck, and before the pregnancy she said we should try for a family while I was the only one working. Asides from the financial issues we were having we also were having a lot of relationship issues including her becoming more manipulative, a drug problem, and threats/attempts of her committing suicide. Up to this point we were both seriously considering divorce. 

Once we found out she was pregnant I asked if we would terminate, and she said she wouldn't. This took me aback as we had already had one termination and we had discussed doing it again if the need arises. She did not want to do it again so I tried to step up and be the one to save the relationship. 

To alleviate some of our issues, I worked more, and tried to be more emotionally available to help her emotional instability (BPD), but it drove me further into resentment because I'd come home from work to see a messy home with no dinner and no help. While I slaved away she would sit on the couch playing video games for 8-10 hours straight. In all fairness, she did this before she was pregnant but it just got worse and worse with each month. 

Now the biggest wedge between us is when she suggested we moved to another state to be closer to her parents. I told her I don't think it'd be a good idea because I wouldn't have any work there and it would just be one more big stress on top of an already tense situation. So she told me she'd move without me and take our child with. She said I would never see him again if I stayed, so I wanted to go and make it work.

Fast forward to now. I am in another state without any of my social circle, and without my source of income (which I also really enjoyed).

I’m so paranoid someone i know might read this because i feel so ashamed.  I have been struggling so much lately with so many things.  I regret having kids.  I have three boys between the ages of 4 and 16. My oldest is from a different relationship, my middle is my bonus child, and my youngest is a product of my current relationship.  I struggle with being emotional available for them and I am constantly filled with guilt and regret almost on the daily for sticking around because I cannot give them what they need. I wish I had the balls to leave but I know I won’t.  I am so guilty over fucking them up, the stress of trying to raise three boys into adults is just overwhelming all the time.  

I don’t hate my kids but their personalities suck, specifically my two oldest who are teenagers.  They are disrespectful, manipulative, rude and inconsiderate and are just mean to their younger brother, who is quite a bit younger.  In public they are fine but neither one of them have any aspirations or dreams.  They have no work ethic, have poor grades, and have just been disappointments in general.  I have nothing in common with any of them and they want nothing to do with me.  

I had this vision of parenthood that was loving and the kids and I would get along and we had a great relationship with each other. Running through a patch of wild flowers type of shit…. It’s literally just arguing and being disappointed.  It’s a constant struggle to get them to understand anything. 

I know this sounds super selfish and ridiculous. 
I guilt myself over feeling so cold to my kids and, i totally regret being a parent. If I could turn back time, I would not have kids. I would tell myself that the time spent worry, regretting, feeling guilty, and always questioning, is just not worth what you get out.  I don’t know why I had kids.  I really don’t. I wanted something that was just a lie.  There is no field of wild flowers and there is no running through it with kids.  By the time you realize you had a field, kids will have burned every last flower to the ground.  

I already feel so fucking ashamed of myself for saying all of this.  I just wish i could just walk away and be fine.  I feel like such a fuck up.

It has been getting a little better now that the kids are a little older (3 &5) but I recently had to hand off cooking meals and grocery shopping to my husband. He also wants to be the only one doing dishes so my only chore is to do the laundry. I can help feed the kids, bathe them, and play with them but I can’t put the kids to sleep by myself. 

I have a somewhat mentally consuming job that I have to commute 50m to each way. I feel like I’m in meetings all day and then I have to get home by a good time to help with the night time routine. 

I feel incredibly guilty. I am a very credentialed and accomplished professional. However after kids, I find it difficult to context switch, get as much done, and wake early. I’m working close to 40 hours but the commute makes it feel extra long. 

I know I give more focus to work and then when I come home I don’t have much energy or desire to be a mom or wife. I know my priorities are messed up but depression and anxiety spike when I can’t control things.

03 March 2025,I was too dumb,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1j2q1zu/i_was_too_dumb/,"\*\*\*LONG\*\*\*

Yep. A dumb 19yr old who was told that they were infertile and ran with it. All I thought about was sex and making money. I wasn't starving for no relationship, still not. Knew that the dummy I was sleeping with and actually came to LIKE was a Fresh & Fit fanboy. But I knew I wasn't like the women they pitched a fit over in almost every episode. I knew I should've stayed away from him when I walked out on him agreeing to something that made me tell him he was fucking disgusting. But hey, I was his and his roommate's ride to work and they were paying me, and it led to sex at the end of the day, so I turned back around and acted like I understood what these toddlers with a podcast were whining about. We agreed on being friends with benefits, even though I knew that was his excuse to sleep with other women okay that's cool. But to still leave me on the side of the road after calling me inconsiderate about making some fried chicken was just too fucking unreal.

Now, I already made a post about how it went when I finally got in contact with him 3 days after I had our son. Lies about having cancer, a vasectomy, yaddah yaddah yaddah so I filed child support on him just for that. Well, after two months of recovering and realizing this dummy was lying. And he continued to do so the second time we called. ""Living his best life"" he said. ""I gotta focus on school and work and I don't even remember you (he did) but if I did, I would've told you to get an abortion because you know I had the money (we were both broke)"" Oh, and this, ""I just wanna die :("" awwWWW BOO fucking WHO 

Oh, he played his part right. I don't fall for just anyone and for me to have only sex and money on my mind and for you to be on mine, yeah you definitely did something there. And of course, I had to have a child with someone who I knew was playing me for a fool. I just let it happen. I didn't want to go through with it, but it was too late and I swear I got a sign from God that I was meant to have him. And He proved it to be so after I had my son. Therefore, I 100% believe that people really show their true colors when you have kids. 

Had a child with an incel, literally hates black women specifically because his mom is and of course, does not have a good relationship with her. Well, thank god I'm not like these OtHeR gIrLs who didn't have a mom, but a supporting widowed father who took on that role. My bd even met my dad and was so bothered about how much my dad respects women, especially HIS woman, he called my father a bitch. Hm, interesting. Can't kiss the ground your girl walks on every now and then? 

Lord, I am beyond a disgrace to my dad who told me my entire life to be careful, and I did the complete opposite. I knew this and knew that, yet I second guessed myself ONCE again and ended up changing my life completely. No more sex and money guys. I learned my lesson and still is. And I'm okay with that.

My sister and I had a wonderful childhood, we always felt loved and knew that our parents were there for us...but man, those fuckers also had A LIFE!

They met friends, hosted parties and on a regular day, they would mostly just go about their business. They took great care of us and were always available when we needed them, but they did not constantly ""parent"" us. Yes, we did do the cliché ""spend the day outside until the streetlamps came on"", but also at home, we usually just played or did stuff without our parents. We were bored sometimes, sure, but then we'd just have to come up with something fun to do or even just live with being bored for a little while.

Nowadays, that is almost seen as child neglect. I feel like society expects parents to entertain and ""work"" their kids 24/7. ""Spending time with kids"" has turned into a mantra that is supposed to be on top of your list of priorities at all times. Afternoons need to be filled with activities, playtime carefully supervised and restaurant visits planned according to the needs and wants of kids (better bring two sets of toys for each and make sure the restaurant has a play area, otherwise we're not going!). Having friends or colleagues come over becomes extremely difficult, because who willl play with the children and what if it affects their bedroom routine?

No wonder that parents today can barely handle all that stress and suffer from a lack of social connections.

My wife is fully on board with that and in full-time mom mode. She does not understand how I can possibly do something else while the kids (6 and 4) are playing in their room - I am supposed to either play along with them or at least be present and watch them. And I spend one evening per month meeting my buddies, I get hit with ""you could be spending that time with the kids"".

My husband does not care for her on the level that I do at all and it is beyond frustrating. I regret adopting her. Why couldn't the state have had her diagnosed before adoption. If that had happened I never would of adopted. I feel lied to and cheated and adoption support is a joke. They don't even offer respite. I think the state should be held accountable for lying to adoptive parents and forcing them to remain in and adoption after it doesn't work out.  I knew I was never meant to be a special needs mom and when I adopted she was not labeled special needs. I am bitter and it affects my daily life. I am in therapy but there is still no changing the shit show I am in. I think it should be illegal for anyone to adopt before the whole family has gone through years of therapy. Or have it be illegal to adopt in the first place. The state is so eager to pawn these children off on someone else so they don't have to care for them anymore and its sickening. Since adopting I have read hundreds of similar stories to mine and it's not okay. More than likely my adopted daughter will not be able to drive or get a real job. There is no way I can keep caring for her after she is 18. I feel like its sucking the life out of me now. I do have a bio kid who is normal and that kid is amazing. Going down the adoption road I wanted to make a difference for a kid but not this. I have a crap ton of regret.",Likely mother: 2 > 0
28 February 2025,Resentment,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1izwhys/resentment/,"I'm the primary caregiver for our newborn (4 weeks). My husband was gone at work today and out of the home for a little over 13 hours. Since 6:00am the baby was nothing but a living nightmare. I would change his diaper, feed him, burp him or he would spit up, feed again if he still showed hunger signs, and then I would try soothing him. I also exclusively pump so throw that into the mix. Repeat this vicious cycle all day long. This baby would not for the of him take a freaking nap... He took maybe one 30 minute nap in the morning, then a 1 hour nap in the afternoon... Other than that he was awake and fussy unless eating... I literally got nothing done... I couldn't because this child was screaming his lungs out every chance he got. I'm back working btw, I work from home so it's not like I'm a stay at home mom (not that being a SAHM is easy by any means, but I'm trying to take care of the house, baby, and do my job).

I told my husband I'm at my breaking point here. I literally can't handle not being able to do a damn thing other than changing his diaper, feeding, burping, and holding him. When I had to set him down to pump (no hands free pump and hands free pumping bras do not work for me) I genuinely thought this baby's head was going to explode from all the screaming he did. My husband said he'd take over when he got home. 

He got back home around 6:30pm. I had just finished feeding him and burping him. Of course this is when the baby decides to be calm and has been sleeping every since my husband came home... Of course my husband gets him when he's easy... He tells me he's got it, I can go take a nap, shower, do whatever I want essentially... But it just makes me so angry that I dealt with literal hell all day today and now he gets to just sit there with the sleeping baby watching him... Must be nice...",Likely mother: 6 > 0
28 February 2025,Why can’t being a mom be like I pictured,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1izvyul/why_cant_being_a_mom_be_like_i_pictured/,"Why couldn't being a mom be like how I pictured?

I'm fucking drowning here. Being a mom was all I ever wanted. I never had a stable mother figure and I just wanted to create something beautiful. I had this whole vision - we'd play, color, have these perfect days where I'd make breakfast, we'd learn together, have lunch, nap time, and they'd wake up happy.

But this shit is HARD. So much harder than anyone told me. I love my child so fucking much it hurts, but most days I feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water.

I get so touched out and tapped out. My toddler is constantly jumping, screaming, breaking boundaries, breaking things. I'm trying to teach them, I'm trying to be patient, but sometimes I just want to escape. Then I feel like the worst parent alive for even thinking that.

The guilt is crushing. I'll leave them with their dad and think ""I hate being around this so much"" and then immediately hate myself for it because I love my kid with everything I have. No matter how hard I try, I feel like I'm failing at this.

What kills me is knowing someday they'll be older. They won't be this small anymore. I won't be able to pick them up and cuddle. Then they'll be a teenager who doesn't want me around. And I'll look back at this time and ask myself ""why didn't you just enjoy it?""

But how do you enjoy something that feels like you're drowning every day? Everyone makes motherhood look so effortless and angelic. It feels like a cruel joke. The only beautiful thing about it is the love I have for my child.

He’s so smart,  beautiful, he’s just being a kid. But sometimes I have to protect myself too. I would NEVER hurt him, but I worry - what if my reactions are too big? What if he see me walking away and think it's about him? What if he’s  acting out because I'm not giving enough attention?

I'm going to keep showing up. Every day I'll try to do better because I fucking love my kid. But I wish motherhood was what they said it would be. I wish it was what I thought it would be.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

And I can't stop regretting my life before. I feel like I've lost my life and my identity. I should specify that before the pregnancy, I lived alone with my cat, I had peace even though I was already diagnosed with depression by my psychiatrist and was on antidepressants and anxiolytics. However, my life was still comfortable, I had a job that I love and a very comfortable salary for just me. My only concern was figuring out how to spend my weekends: shopping or walking around Paris, it was cool. Fast forward, I met my partner, I got pregnant with twins, it was a difficult pregnancy that led to several hospitalizations, injections, infusions, stress, and an emergency cesarean delivery due to preeclampsia. My children stayed in neonatology for almost 1 month. Today they are 4 months old, I love them but can't stand this life. Stuck in a monotonous, hellish routine with my partner and my twins. I can’t stand anything anymore and I dream so much of going back. It’s too much for me, I have no peace anymore: neither mentally nor financially. I feel so trapped in this life while before I was so free. My only constraint was my job but I loved being there so it wasn’t really a constraint. I will return to work in 2 months, my partner will take care of the children at home. He thinks I will feel better but I am sure it will worsen the situation because he will have double the stress at home. My peace is gone, my life is over, I am just a slave to the babies, or at least that’s how I feel every day. Is it postpartum depression?

Then we both went into panic mode and got married two weeks later (I know I know). I had made three separate appointments in the first 24 weeks of my pregnancy, and each time, he would cry and have a whole breakdown which ultimately led to me keeping the pregnancy. Then after it’s too late in the pregnancy I learn that he’s an avid RFK fanatic. Believes kids can catch autism from the MMR shot. Believes the COVID PCR tests gave him cancer. Believes that in a city where dirty needles are constantly found in playgrounds, the sidewalks, etc. that it is wise still to wait on the hep A vax.

27 February 2025,I regret becoming a parent because now I feel trapped to my wife,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iz6oqr/i_regret_becoming_a_parent_because_now_i_feel/,"New dad to a beautiful amazing 6 months old in 2y marriage. I never actively wanted kids. You could say I was agnostic. But I thank God for this sweetest little boy everyday and try my best to step up to the challenge. I do miss the freedom in my previous life badly but I try to take it one day at a time. The problem is my wife.

To preface, I believe I do my fair share:
* I work a stressful job and bring in 2/3 of the household income. I manage the family finance.
* I cook most meals. For the meals I don’t cook, we order takeaway.
* By default, I change every nappy, give him a bath every night and do every bottle. The only thing I don’t do is the breastfeeding because I don’t have boobs.
* I wake up with my wife whenever he wakes up. 
* We also have a daytime nanny and a weekly cleaner so there is help when I’m at work.

I also strictly follow a few principles:
* I never compare my wife to anyone else, be it as a person, as a mom or as a wife.
* I never comment on her appearance after birth. FWIW I find her curvy body now so much sexier than before but whenever I try to bring that up as a compliment, she got self conscious so quickly I turned off completely.
* I believe in spending money to help with her recovery, eg holidays at relaxing resorts

Here is what makes things so miserable for me:
* I don’t matter. At all. No please. No thank you. No how are you doing, how are you feeling, etc. No acknowledgement that this shit is hard and I’m also trying my best.
* Good things are expected but bad things are my fault. By default. Doesn’t matter what it is. If she needs help, I find help. If I need help or have problems, it’s my fault.
* She could lost her temper and scream at the kid once a day and I scramble to make her and the kid feel better. I lost my temper once and she made me feel like the worst dad on earth.
* There is no way for me to disagree with her on anything, kid-related or otherwise.
* The inlaws are fucking insane.

I know I’m not perfect. I’m grumpy but fuck me I sleep two to four hours per night, work 9 hours, go home and cook and do the night routine and work again, so excuse me if I don’t smile when waking up.

I just feel so trapped. Without this kid, I would be so far gone from this marriage. But the thing is I grow up knowing how negatively an abusive / neglecting parent can impact a kid’s life. I don’t want to leave him now. 50/50 custody is never 50/50 in practice.

FML

Edit: Oh actually I forgot what pisses me off the most is her constant comparison of me and other men / husbands. Whenever I make mistakes or brings up a problem, it’s always “I never see so and so complain / have problems”

Bitch please, are you there when they complain?

Edit 2: Lots of people rightfully pointed out ppd / therapy / couple counselling. I went to therapy and took med many years ago for bipolar depression. I’m doing much much better these days. 1M+ net worth and functional as a human. Happiness is neither here nor there but that’s beside the point.

The thing is I asked her to go to couple counselling MANY TIMES before but she flat out rejected. In her mind, she is very clear what the problem is and that is I’m an unhappy person. I told her I just wanted a safe space to discuss issues objectively on equal footing but she said there is nothing ambiguous to discuss. 

Post partum I also suggested individual therapy for her many times when she was dealing with all sort of difficulties like breastfeeding woes, relationships with her mom etc. She also rejected it.

Edit 3: if there is any doubt, taking out trash, groceries, walking the dog…. All me

Edit 4: I can’t believe I need to explain the mechanics of my claims but for example, when I say “I change every nappy by default” it means if I’m present I’m the one who does it. Obviously if I’m at work then the nanny does it. But on Saturday and Sunday, I do all of it. I don’t claim to teleport home to change nappy then teleport back to work.",Likely father: 5 > 2

The father of my children is ADHD or even more autistic than that. He doesn't manage his symptoms. He forgets I exist. He screams at the kids and frightens them to shut them up. I can't stand it, but I have no money to leave. 

He has a potentially high paying job, but staying in his proximity has made me extremely nervous to the point where my heart rhythm is messed up and I have stress pain in my chest. He is often angry and always careless.

Kids love him, no matter what he does. He ignores all the kids' rules - bedtime, getting dressed, eating. I'm the bad one, who ""forces"" kids to go to bed. Always a fight. I have addressed the issue many times, but the father just doesn't care. Deep inside he knows that it's a woman's job to take care of children and the household and the father just goes to work or is on his phone.

I never planned to have kids but everyone around me told me ur never ready till it happens.

Me and my partner stopped drinking and doing drugs, moved an hour away and settled down (we aren’t married, just started a more sedentary life) a year after we moved I finally managed to pick up a job in a town near by and was happy to finally be making my own money again, a month into working again my partner suggested having a kid and I said I wasn’t ready, we had previously took per-caution to not have kids, and I wasn’t ready to stop those. About a month after that (two months into my job) I found out I was pregnant. And about 8.5 months in I suggested quitting since I couldn’t get paternity leave since I was part time, and standing for 8 hours a day was causing too much swelling. He told me I could quit and just focus on raising our daughter and it sounded nice so that’s what I did.

She’s now a year old, and I’m absolutely fucking miserable. I’m home 24/7 and doing everything. Literally everything. He only watched her ONE night after she was born, got frustrated with the crying and never helped again. I slept on the couch with her bassinet for 6 months. I did every bottle, every diaper, every bath, clothes changing, you name it. 

I do every chore, dishes, mopping, laundry, making every meal, all the pet care, on top of 6 hours of school every day, taking care of her. Literally every fucking thing.

I love her to death but she’s driving me absolutely insane. I know she’s 1, she’s just a toddler but saying “no” 5 million times a day because she keeps wanting to touch all her dads legos and toys, that he refuses to put up, is so fucking draining.

I have 0 human interaction outside of my child, and a partner who acts like they hate me. I have no friends, no family to talk to. Nothing. I can’t drive because my autism makes me freeze up behind the wheel and causes severe panic attacks from sensory overload and anxiety.

23 February 2025,I'm a shit parent as I've come to hate being around my kid,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iwg9zl/im_a_shit_parent_as_ive_come_to_hate_being_around/,"I’m at my wits end and feel like an abject failure as a parent and human being and thought I’d vent here in hopes I’m not judged too harshly… I’m gonna give some background as it may be relevant.

I’m a single parent to 2 kids aged 13 and 16. I left their bio dad when they were still very young (under 5) and he has not engaged significantly in their life. I’ve had to figure it all out pretty much on my own without support from either side of the family but we’ve made do and they had a fairly happy childhood as best as I could provide… I’ve struggled financially so not always had much to spend but I’m very good at budgeting and make sure I’m very thrifty with budget for basics so that they didn’t miss out on too many of the “normal” childhood experiences, for example we go  on holiday at least once a year and they’ve never gone without essential and have ample day trips, clubs and in house stuff.

My relationship with their bio dad was a toxic one and I had to escape for my own survival. Whilst we were together he was controlling, paranoid, and violent with me however he never raised a hand to either of our kids and at no point did I think they were at risk from him (this is relevant for later).  I am a firm believed that kids should be able to have relationships with both parents and not get caught in the middle so I went to great lengths to include “dad” in their lives but he would only spend time with them when I offered babysitting money (which never got spent on them) and when I couldn’t afford to pay him for childcare any longer he simply stopped communicating with them at all for years (no birthday or xmas cards, no response to invites, cross road when he saw us etc…). Despite all of this I still covered for him with kids and explained he still loves them but needs time to get better mentally and reconnect when he was better and I never said anything bad about him in front of kids as still their dad….

Fast forward to 2023 and kids want to reconnect with bio dad and he starts to have some interactions. My oldest was initially excited but was upset every time they visited as dad constantly disrespected their interests and lifestyle choices and largely ignored them to focus on younger child. My eldest decided on own that they didn’t want to pursue that relationship further and I respected that but my youngest wanted to continue so had almost regular 2/3x per month day visits at dads place and occasional overnight.

Around this same time I was involved in a very triggering historic abuse legal case (me being the victim) and my mental health took a significant dive. I ended up on variety of medications some of which will leave me fatigued and I need a lot more rest than I used to, I also get disoriented and sometimes blackout. I explained to kids what was happening and reassured them I’d get better but in meantime might need to depend on them a little more for help round the house and with meals etc (I’ve been cooking with both kids for years and they’re both fully capable of making their own meals and the kitchen is always stocked with a range of choices they like). I don’t have any family support to call on but I did reach out to social services and school to explain situation and ask for support only to be told we don’t meet criteria for help so I muddled through as best I could however I wasn’t as engaged and interactive as previously, my hormones were all over the place, and as part of my downward spiral I also fucked up few times in this period, For example one time I got blackout drunk after tone of the days in court and apparently staggered home and passed out semi dressed on couch which obviously upset kids, another time they came home from school early and caught me snogging a guy in living room (I don’t bring dates back as a hard rule but made an impulsive decision on this one occasion which backfired). Each time I fucked up we’d sit down, talk everything through, and try to move forward. I reached out to mental health team and docs for support but I didn’t meet the criteria for anything useful except meds… 

My eldest was very empathetic and has accepted the situation is as good as I can do and I’m getting support to recover (I’m now seeing trauma therapist and meds alongside)… My youngest however started to lash out and developed massive rage issues (this had never previously been a problem)… My youngest however starts lashing out at me verbally and being really nasty… things like shit mum, I deserve to be abused (I had an abusive childhood and not in contact with my family as a result), dad is better parent, I don’t love him, I’m neglecting my kids needs because I’m so selfish I’m making it all about me with my bs physical/mental conditions which I’m obviously making up as attention seeking way to avoid being a parent to my children…. As some examples. He also starts accusing me of being a whore, fucking up his relationship with his wonderful dad (dad claimed I’d prevented contact for years however I have evidence opposite was true)… I snapped eventually and said I’d had enough of accusations from what his dad had been saying and actually the truth is that it was a toxic marriage I had to escape to survive and the only reason I put up with the abuse from dad for so long was because I had thought abuse was normal part of long term relationship as that’s all I’d ever experience. I’ve had a lot of counselling since and know my boundaries now however I had a lifelong history of toxic relationships previous to that.

Anyway, the situation quickly progressed from verbal to physical and before I know it he starts flying into these rages where he’d get physical with me with no warning… It started as occasional but increased to daily within a few months. He would punch, kick, bite, rip out chunks of my hair, throw things at me, break my glasses, cause damage etc and at few points tried threatening me with knife. I ended up with black eyes, bloody noses, and bruises regularly and even tho I was able to protect my eldest child it was really horrible for them to witness and after several months of this I literally began to fear for hospitalisation from next attack. I was honest with all support agencies and begged them for help daily throughout however (despite the safety factor) we didn’t qualify for support. I tried everything from talking therapy, to practical activities, firm discipline etc but nothing changed the behaviours and it was really impacting me physically and mentally as all of a sudden it felt like I was in a domestic abuse situation all over again but I couldn’t leave as it was my child hurting me. After one particularly bad attack I called the police because I thought it may put the fear in him but he just got attitude with them instead. They saw the physical damage he’d done to me and the house and removed him to his dad’s to ensure my safety and that of my other child.

He lived with dad for 5 months and I attempted to rebuild our relationship as best we could and things seemed to be improving. Turns out however that his dad had started using him as a punchbag early on and constant verbal belittling  - when I found out I obviously brought him back home and we all 3 resolved to try and make it work this time. Since he’s moved back several months ago tho our relationship has started deteriorating again as has my mental health, once again I’m getting daily verbal abuse, he won’t help at all round house – point blank refuses, he doesn’t respect any of the house rules or boundaries and has resorted to his whole violent ways on several occasions. He now has access to variety of talking therapies, activity support groups, mental health professionals etc however he refuses to engage in any of them and I’m left between violent episodes just living in fear of what will set off the next one. I’ve tried talking to my son about the impact his behaviours have on me and he just tells me to fuck off and get over it already as I’m a shitty parent anyway and I shouldn’t be making a big deal out of these “isolated” incidents… The verbal nastiness literally occurs several times a day and is really targeted. I am consistent with his punishment (he pays for any damages and gets automatic fines for violence which get deducted from pocket money, also grounding loss of electronics and everything) and always follow through with consequences as have 0 tolerance to violence in home. I know its only verbal but it cuts to the bone when he says hurtful things I can’t argue with like “I know I’m violent and nasty however that’s your fault as you’re the one that raised me that way”, “no wonder your parents abused you, you obviously deserved it”, “you’re a worthless pathetic joke incapable of being loved – no wonder you’re single, not even your parents could stand you”, “pathetic, fat ugly bitch”… He is also offensive to any of my friends to the point that I’m not allowed to invite anyone over for any reason whilst he is there and I can’t anyway as no-one wants to visit anymore due to how he is if/when I have a visitor.

This is impacting me so much at this stage that I literally feel like ending it all. I can’t send him back to his dad (he has gone no contact again), I’ve not got family support got so desperate I even looked at social care options however apparently we don’t meet criteria for support as they still see some of my family as being suitable options (despite their history of abusing me throughout my childhood). I’ve started believing the constant put downs and he’s right I have fucked up as a parent multiple times and have failed them. I’ve been winging it their entire lives without support or role models to work off and am still trying to evolve to be a better parent however I’ve obviously failed completely as if the proof is in the pudding then I’ve obviously fucked up royally.

I feel bad for being selfish and making it all about me by getting therapy and trying to get myself out of house and meet folk etc or do activities as he’s obviously feeling neglected when I do. I feel horrible for all my many mistakes and how its impacted them. Worst of all my child now feels towards me how I felt towards my parents and I never thought that would be the case – its devastating. I’m scared if he doesn’t get him past this as a child that he’ll end up in a cell as an adult and there doesn’t seem to be anything I can do to change this trajectory. My mental health has spiralled and I’m struggling so bad I just feel the need to escape him but that makes me feel guilty as he’s my kid.

I still love him and don’t want to give up hope but tbh I have also started to hate him and I never thought I’d feel that way about my child. I don’t know what to do and if I’m being honest I’ve given up – I don’t know what to try that I haven’t tried, I cant do right for doing wrong an a constant basis and I dread being in his company with rare exceptions. I’m aware this means he’s right but I’m obviously in shit parent club as its truly how I feel. I’ve even contemplated how much better my kids would be without me and have visions of everythung from walking away one day and never coming home to suicide… As my mental health deteriorates further my emotional state has got more volatile and I’m finding myself getting more and more reactive to these incidents mostly verbally but twice physically when I hit back when he punched me before he had a chance to react – both cases I apologised immediately after and we talked through for days and neither hard enough to injure. I’ve been honest with social work too but no support available apart from talking to him but he knows everything to say and says all the right things only to continue repeating behaviours with me at home. It’s literally got to the point now where I hate my own child and I currently wish I’d never had him as last 10 years of financial, emotional, physical effort is apparently worthless and all I’ve actually managed to do is raise one child with anxiety (my eldest) and another child that looks all set to be a perpetrator of DV in his future relationships. But then again that’s me making it all about me again so that’s me down the rabbit hole on a guilt trip to beat all guilt trips and right now I literally just seem to be bouncing between emotional states...",Likely mother: 8 > 4
23 February 2025,I regret becoming a sahm mother,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iwjy6x/i_regret_becoming_a_sahm_mother/,"I became a mother because at the time that I found out I was pregnant I was head over heels in love. I was very afraid because I didn’t know him well. I went over my options and my partner didn’t want me to get an abortion at that time. If I got an abortion I was definitely going to lose him forever so i stayed and decided to be responsible. I had my baby and then things changed. The birth was BRUTAL. I got post partum depression. And to make matters worse I stopped working to become a sahm so that we could save money on childcare which is VERY expensive in nyc. My partner was NOT locked in. He is the working parent so I try to not put too much on him but honestly the only thing he will do is work and provide money. I have no support. No family or friends. No one has helped me do anything and I’m self neglecting. I have been so drained. I haven’t had a day to myself in over a year. No dates, no partying, absolutely nothing but cooking cleaning and wiping poop all day every day. I am going crazy. I’m at a point where I’m trying to get on anti depressants. I try to speak up and get support from family or friends but no one cares because I’m “unemployed”. I haven’t worked in over a year so Im finding it tough to find a job. I’m not a lazy person. I have two degrees, very educated, I used to be very fit, social. I have no time for that anymore. I regret this lifestyle so much. When I tell my partner he gets upset with me. I feel like a terrible mom but also like I am being abused in my relationship. I don’t have sex because I don’t have a sex drive at all. There’s no romance. I feel like I’m only there to cook clean and have sex with. He plays with his baby but he doesn’t really have to parent. So everything falls on me. I mean dude at least take him out for a bit. Giving me a few hours to myself would be nice. He refuses to parent our child without me around. I feel trapped. Now I’m gaining weight, I’m isolated and my toddler is BAD. He breaks things and destroys the house so bad. He’s busy and needs constant stimulation. He was screened and doesn’t have autism. He’s just bad. I know this is a safe space so I’m just venting.  How do I set boundaries and get out of this trap? How can I just be present and grateful when I loved my single childfree life so much more than this? Yes I love my kid. He’s a good kid but parenting is absolutely draining me. Especially doing it all alone. Can anyone relate?",Likely mother: 3 > 0

This girl told me all about how he approached her while she was out shopping at the mall and offered to take her to get her nails done. He took her to get her nails done and then put her in his car and began to masturbate to her feet. He kept in touch with her throughout my entire pregnancy and would send her money and buy her shoes in exchange of pictures of her feet and to masturbate to her feet on video call. The girl sent me a google drive file with every email exchanged between them.. When I first read these emails I was disgusted. I reported him to the police but nothings happened, I’m not sure if anything will happen. I had a therapy appointment yesterday and I discussed this with my therapist as it’s been weighing heavy on my mind.. I don’t know why this traumatized me so immensely.. Last night I couldn’t sleep and I decided to open the file she sent me and noticed I missed some messages between them ..

My daughter is a complete terror.

Telling the kid that she deserved to die and she should kill herself. Texting group chats expressing her sadistic thoughts. She enjoys bringing pain to people she says…it brings her joy she says…she won’t stop she says. I believe her. To put the icing on the cake when she came back to school she revealed to the Principal that she has been planning to murder me and she wanted to freeze my cat to death in the deep freezer.(He’s gone now in a new home). What was the response to all this? The same as always. Useless CPS with their resources and programs, useless therapy, useless new meds, and the cycle will continue. Maybe if she does kill me in my sleep people would realized she needs to be locked up away from society. There is something more to her than what she’s already diagnosed with.

I'm not leaving my husband. he's not absent by choice - he's working hundreds of miles away driving tankers, living in the truck, saving as much as he can for us to be able to move to a place with better resources and opportunities for our kids than are available in our current location. i wish you'd all try to have more empathy and stop telling me to leave him, or automatically assuming that he's a monster. i recognize that it's my mistake not giving enough information or by only disclosing negative, but remember that you can't get an accurate picture of my family's whole life from this post, you know? i welcome advice but I'm not going to be breaking my family apart, especially not when we're actively working toward finally being together again for good. at this point I'm talking to him about getting our oldest into school. he thinks that i should just wait until we are in a new place, which will hopefully be by the end of summer (so near the beginning of the school year). i don't think we should wait. but we're talking about it.



An edit: school would help. You're all correct. Part of the issue and why they're not in school already is that my husband has a deep mistrust of public OR private schools where we live right now, and expects me to homeschool. I've tried to say that I'm unable to do this, but he thinks what he thinks (I'm not trying to drag him) and I know that I'm struggling and that NOT having at least my oldest in school is harmful to us all. I'm just so tired of being completely on my own in parenting and all of this.


original post:
I have 3 kids aged 3, 4, and 7. We are always together. Always. I'm a solo sahm with my husband working very far away. I'm homeschooling them (it isn't going well. I've managed to teach the older two to read, and I'm very proud of that, but I am so overwhelmed I can't get much further). I try very hard to do everything that's needed... Keeping our kids healthy, trying to provide stimulation and activity, while also staying on top of groceries and laundry, cleaning the house... I am drowning so badly. Hopefully there's a light at the end of the tunnel coming toward the summer time but the fact is I've been at this mostly alone for 7 years. My older 2 kids lately are fighting almost constantly and saying such horrible things to each other, they hit each other, they say they hate each other... On top of every other thing that I'm dealing with, it completely wrecks me. I feel like i might be able to do this if we all had less of a fighting attitude and worked together as a little family team, and realized how fortunate we are. i regret having 3. i love all of them but the 3rd kids the most difficult (she is constantly screaming) and was a surprise, too. i think we've done all of them an injustice by having 3. there's no village. there's no support. there's no babysitter, nothing. their one kid friend lives in another city and is in a private school and tons of activities and always busy, so we never see her. we are insular and isolated and i feel like i am unable to keep my head above water. i can't even safely go to another room for a few minutes to breathe because they'll start screaming at each other and fighting, and/or get into trouble when they know I'm not looking. I have NO WAY to escape, ever. I even sleep in the same room as the 3 of them. I wish i could figure out most of all how to stop the fighting between them. it's how we start most days and it's nearly impossible for me to re-regulate afterward. there's always screaming coming from our house. tantrums before 7:30 on the regular. i want to do so much more than I'm physically capable of doing. they deserve my best but my best is barely ""okay"" and I'm terrified of all the days lost already. I'm terrified of their future, i feel like i am utterly failing them all. i want to put them into school but our living situation will hopefully be changing drastically around the summer time, and i feel like it's too stressful to try and put them in school for just a few short months of what would already be major upheaval and adjustment, only to pull them out of it and thrust them into yet another massively different situation. i feel like i'm in limbo and trapped and it feels like the future is reaching toward me, yet every day is exactly the same, and will the future actually be easier? i don't know. i wanted kids but if i had known how much of it i would be doing alone and how much i'd feel like dying, and how much screaming there'd be, i might have stopped at one. i don't want to live like this. i love them so much but I'm not doing the best for them.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

I’ve been following this community for quite some time now. Not because I’m particularly regretful, but because you guys give the most honest parenting advice I can find on the internet, period. And honestly, there’s nothing wrong with regretting some of your life decisions.

I never wanted to have kids. But then I got a bit older, found my wife, and thought, “Why not?” Fast forward, and now I have a 3-year-old toddler with an absolutely challenging personality. I know this is a stage, and I get it, but she’s impossible. She fights every single thing we ask her to do. Our whole day is filled with screams, cries, and arguments. I understand I need to be the bigger person (and her mum does too), but it’s getting under my skin on a daily basis. It’s just too much. She doesn’t sleep well, which obviously doesn’t help with staying calm.

The latest? She has decided she refuses to go pee in the bathroom and ends up peeing herself literally 3-4 times a day. We’re going to schedule an appointment, but I’m leaning toward the thought that she’s making a statement because she literally fights going to the bathroom. We’ve tried everything with her, but we’re out of strategies.

Given that this is my life now, and I’m kind of a loner, I need to vent this frustration. I’d hate to end up saying something I regret to my daughter or my wife—or worse, feeling like I don’t want to come home anymore. When I say I’m a loner, I mean I don’t enjoy going out drinking or socializing; that’s not my style. But I DO NEED to vent this out, otherwise, I’ll project my frustrations at home. Every night, I go to bed at the end of my rope, and every morning, I wake up to my daughter’s smile, but I don’t feel like smiling anymore. I don’t want her to feel like her dad doesn’t love her. She’s innocent in all of this—if anything, it’s our fault as adults. I have a child now, and there’s no turning back, so I want to deal with it the best way I can.

19 February 2025,Becoming a parent is making me suicidal and I don't know where it's going to lead.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1itijtn/becoming_a_parent_is_making_me_suicidal_and_i/,"I am a 27 year old man, I have one 7mo son with my wife and I have hated my life from the moment I found out she was pregnant with him.

Just to preface, I have struggled with extreme levels of depression and hallucination-induced anxiety attacks my entire life, which peaked at around 17 years old for me, and continued at this peak until around the time I was 23. From 19 to 22 I was actively planning my suicide on the day of my 22nd birthday, but I chickened out, ended up getting sucked into my work life, and kind of slowly built myself back up as something somewhat resembling a human being. Previously I had tried many medications and therapy, counseling, etc. which were useless for me. I found that I was able to create a lifestyle for myself that helped soothe and sweeten, if not entirely cure, my heavy depression. This consisted of creating for myself ample personal space, personal free time, and developing routines and meditation to deal with my internal issues. In this time I was happy and at peace for the only years of my entire adult life, and the only years of my life at all since I was 8 years old. This peace allowed me to hold off the stronger aspects of depression and take the time to address my internal issues without outside interference.

So if you have kids and/or you have ever been depressed to this level you can probably begin to see the problem. There are a lot of layers to all this and it took me some time to unravel all of it. Unfortunately by the time I realized exactly what parenthood was going to entail it was too late. I eventually met a girl and we dated and got engaged, yada yada. I was at the time in love with her, and when she said that she really wanted me to get her pregnant and to have kids, I guess my dumb ass was partially afraid of losing her, and partially believing that I could somehow integrate children into my existing life, and did not foresee that it would be the equivalent of dropping a nuclear bomb on the carefully crafted daily escapes that I had. In the month after the first time that we skipped using protection, I really felt a sick sense in my gut that I had to tell her I couldn't do it. I still had no idea what was in store but I just didn't feel like it was right. I still remember a day when we went on a walk and she was talking about how she was down about not being pregnant yet and all I could think was ""I can't do this, I hate this, I need to tell her no and walk away from this"". Unfortunately her becoming pregnant was way easier than we both thought. Abortion was not an option for her and I knew that so I kept my feelings in. From the very moment we found out I have felt like my heart is about to explode from the pressure and stress. At first I thought ""ok, now I just have to somehow be responsible, somehow I'm going to be alright and I'll get into the swing of being a parent. Everyone does, right? Everyone is programmed to reproduce, right?"". For the last year and a half I have been waiting for the magic moment when suddenly I actually like having 2 seconds of free time a day and feeling like I work for no thanks and stress to no end. There was no magic moment of loving this child, I feel a deep sense of the heaviness of his life and the weight of the responsibility, but I feel no joy and if I could go back in time and erase his birth from this world, I would. The anxiety attacks have built up more and more every month until last month I went out for ""work"" one day and sat in the car screaming at myself for 8 hrs. I miss being able to be a human being so much and pretty much every day now I weigh the option of suicide. I really do not see myself doing this for another year let alone another 20+. I've told some of this to my wife and she really isn't sympathetic, she loves being a mother and I think due to her family environment, has always wanted more children in her life. Before becoming a mother she wanted to build a career in ECE. She really just thinks I'm crazy.

Honestly I don't see how I can be a good parent while living like this, I hate the idea of being a deadbeat dad and I hate the idea of ruining a childs life, but i have no idea if I can wake up tomorrow and keep doing this. I don't want to hear how ""it gets better"". That's the same thing people said about depression. Guess what? It only ever got a little less bad. And now it's bad again. I really don't see much of a point in staying a live if this is what life has in store for me. I see how other peoples lives are consumed by their family now that I'm actually paying attention, and how children suck up every bit of energy for at least the first 5 years of their life. I won't make it alive through 5 years of this. I wish so strongly that I had not being such a weak man and that I had separated from her to let her find someone who could have enjoyed a life with kids.

Honestly I don't want advice, I've read it all, and I've just come to the conclusion that the kind of people that eventually get used to it are also the kind of people that I knew I 100% was not like for many, many years before ever considering a child. I simply wish i had realized that you have to be like that and be able to handle the hyper busy, always doing shit lifestyle if you ever decide to have children. I could just barely handle working 32 hrs a week with my household daily chores always sliding a bit, let alone being ""on the clock"" every moment of the day from wake up until the moment my head hits the pillow. I'm just a fucking shell of a human being now and I want it to stop, however that has to happen.

  
UPDATE: I'm gonna be sick. Found out after her post-partum birth control assessment appointment that she is actually pregnant. Somehow despite using condoms and having sex so fucking rarely, my sperm is so fucking fertile that she is pregnant again. What the fuck. What the actual fuck. I want to ask for an abortion but she is pro-life due to her christian background. I'm gonna kill myself.",Likely father: 4 > 3

Then i realised how much i hate weekends, i find it soul destroying looking after the baby from morning till night which is quite selfish as my gf is on paternity and that is all she does all day shes finding it hard too.

Thats why i was specifically going to tell her i have these days off but then i thought no i need this for my mental health, i left home as normal for work and just did what i wanted! Had lunch, went to a cafe, stopped by to see my brother and parents (pretended i was passing by during my lunch break) it was fantastic! To the point where i think ill do this atleast 1 day a month from now on obviously not too much to arose suspicion!

I do feel a lil bad tho if my gf found out she'd probably be fuming like you had the day off and didnt want to stay with me and the kids?

New dad here to a 4 month old boy me and my partner are both 30, i completely hate my life and im in a deep deep depression, i will have to leave my partner as i cant continue waking up hating my life.

To set the scene me and my current gf were together for 5 months, we fall pregnant i say we as we both didnt take the precausions we should have, i say we because we both agreed to have the child as we dont agree with abortion(big mistake).

Having my child was my biggest mistake, i wish i had the courage to have an abortion im full of regret every scan i wished nature would save me and take its course and she would miscarry but she never did. I am a true coward i was to scared of admitting i didnt want this child and im not ready. I just did what i thought was the ""right thing to do"" and got on with it. I now commend people who have abortions, who have the courage to go against societal expectations and do what they feel is right for THEIR future. 

I agreed to move in with her even though i didnt want to, to play happy family and try and be a good father but its making me extremely unhappy and i cant do it anymore. I feel phyisically sick when i look at family photos of us like this is my worst nightmare i cant believe ive let this happen.

Anyway im going to take control of my life im going to leave soon im just waiting for the right moment, i dont care what anyone says id rather commit suicide than live like this for the rest of my days and thats a FACT! Will i commit suicide no, but will i be unhappy for the rest of my life if i stay here playing happy fake family yes i can say with 100% certainty. Only reason im staying is because i do feel really sorry for my partner having to do this alone, i wish we just had an abortion or i used a damn condom. Im staying because i dont wanna leave immediatly and bring shame from my family i also was like id stay as i dont wanna miss first words or steps etc but i couldnt care less tbh. Id happily never see my kid again if i had the chance so why tf do i think seeing first steps is going to feel any different? 

We are in newborn hell night feeds etc i feel guilty allowing my partner to do that all on her own, so im planning to wait maybe a year before i leave i know its wrong to live a lie for a year but i feel its the right thing to do, when the baby sleeps more etc can walk is more independent (still a full time job i know) then i think i can leave. Also it will be less shame from friends and family if i do a year at least im pathetic i know i should just leave but that wont happen for now as id feel to guilty.

Some advice please i know people will say it will get better but i know in my heart it wont, im too selfish i love a carefree life where i can do what i want im not spending my life raising this child and sacraficing my freedom. I also dont even love my gf we were together for 5 months for christs sake, i didnt make her my wife or life partner, so why should i play house because we have an unplanned child and be unhappy for the rest of my life? Tbh i know i dont love her which is why i want to leave but i also think even if i did love her id still want to leave as fatherhood isnt for me giving up my life for a child who will most likely be ungrateful in 18 years (like we all are to our parents cmon the sacrafice theyve given to us we and i dont appreciate our parents enough) just isnt worth it for me.

So please just have a read and let me know what u think, should i wait a year? Should i continue to live a lie to support my gf through newborn hell? Will it get better im sure it wont? Will i get over the guilt when i leave? How do i tell my partner? Should i just be honest and tell her i dont love her? Or should i say its because i hate fatherhood? In all honesty were playing happly family after a 5 month relationship, its ridiculous tbh. Having a child is a huge commitment some marraiges dont survive children so why should a 5 month relationship and unplanned child survive like lets be realistic here?",Likely father: 5 > 1

Oddly enough, we had broken up a few years back for about 2 months because I was on the fence about children. She was not at all. To quote her, “I have always wanted to be a mother”.

I did a lot of introspection and came to the conclusion I did want children. We got back together, had a baby. 

From the day we took our child home she had a massive panic attack. The first few weeks she was severely PPD. I did the vast majority of feeding and spending time with our child in that time. I tried to give her everything she needed. 

Our child had gastrointestinal issues and colic. He screamed for hours on end. Because of the gastro issues our pediatrician put him on a hypoallergenic formula because she couldn’t figure out what was causing it in her diet. It helped but he was just crazy fussy for probably 8 months. 

All this to say I think our child may have been a bit more challenging than many others in this period. 

I am not regretful. Through it all I have loved being a father. I love seeing him grow and I love the exciting firsts as much as the mundaneness of it all. 

I can tell my wife is regretful to some extent. She talks about being young again, and how much she misses it. How she feels she’s lost herself and now she is JUST a mother. She speaks to how hard it is and asks when it will get better. She’s sad. She misses excitement, I think. 

I encourage her to do basically whatever she wants, when she wants. I’ve adjusted my work schedule so she can go to the gym when she wants. She goes out most weekends to get her nails done, or get lunch with her family/friends, I encourage her to take trips or shopping days. Or go party like she’s 25 again. It doesn’t seem to do much. 

I wake up with him at 5-6 every day. I stay with him until I take him to daycare or have to leave for work. I pick him up from daycare. I get home from work and usually feed him and play with him until bedtime. She puts him to bed usually. I do this as well probably twice a week but she does enjoy him falling asleep with her. 

I am happy to do whatever I conceivably can to help my wife. I try to take as much of the day-day stuff as I can. I have volunteered to do more cooking/cleaning if she’d rather watch him. 

I’ve read many posts here of people without the help they need. I am that help, so if you had it what would you want? 

I dont ever expect her to magically wake up one day a LOVE being a mother, but idk. It just seems she is waiting for it to “get better” and I know that it just gets different. I don’t want to make her feel bad or guilty over how she feels as well.

My biggest rage and anger is his immediate outbursts when he doesn't get something, the hitting, screeching/yelling, the throwing things, his inability to even TRY to communicate when I try to help him is literally making me want to yeet myself off a bridge somewhere. In just the last 48 hours, the 20% of ""happy calm"" moments are immediately overtaken and shadowed by the incessantness of just him being a toddler. And, I know - I know - this is par for the course. He's ""supposed"" to be doing what he's doing.   
The moment I wake up with him to when he's either put down for a nap or bed time - I have been feeling I'm in a literal nightmare hell. He's at that exact stage he doesn't know what he wants and when he 'thinks' he knows he wants something; he gets mad that you even tried to give him the thing he asked for. I'm overstimulated and over touched.

I am not meant for this part of motherhood. If I'm being any bit of honest with myself - I really am not made for this. I miss my old life at times.

He's 2.5 years old, and he is so awful and annoying. I've heard about the ""terrible two's"" and the ""threenagers"" but really the terrible 2s started when he turned 1. He's just getting worse. I'm walking on eggshells 24/7 and don't know how to be around my kid because he's constantly unhappy. Anything and everything will set him off. I've gotten to a point where I don't follow anyone's advice anymore because none of it works. The boy does not listen to me in any shape or form, but yet he's always calling for my attention (""Mommy, mommy"" on repeat is all I hear all day long). He doesn't leave me alone not even so I can take 2 minutes to pee. If I lock the door to the bathroom, he kicks and screams at the door then has a 20-min long temper tantrum. He is covered in bruises and cuts because he can't sit still not even for a second, and he gets into everything. His Saturday gymnastics teacher gets annoyed with him because he doesn't pay attention to her neither and can't get him to do any of the tasks in the class. In the meantime, the other kids pay attention and do everything she says. This is just the tip of the iceberg. 

By the time Sunday afternoon rolls around, I don't want to see him anymore until the next day (if I could go a full week without being around him, I would!). I remember shortly after he turned 1, I wrote a post in here about how I didn't like him. He behaved the same way back then, except now he's more uncontrollable because he's bigger and physically stronger. He's always been a whiny, irritable child who is nearly impossible to please. And he's so incredibly stubborn. I can't discipline him because he ignores everything I say. I'm losing my voice as I write this because I've screamed and called out to him so many times, and he completely ignores me. It's like talking to a wall. And I'm stressing about potty training him because I've attempted twice now, and he refuses to potty train and actually demands that I put the diaper back on him. I'm so sick of this kid. I mean, literally I'm sick of him, too, because he gets me sick ALL the time. I got over a cold a week ago and yesterday I started to feel like I was catching a cold again, so today I woke up with full-on cold symptoms. I was just sick last week! I used to never get sick before my son was born. I AM SO DONE. 

I used to say to myself shortly after he was born that I wished someone else would take care of him and that I preferred my cat to him. I still wish the same thing today, after 2.5 years. I do not and have not enjoyed motherhood at all. My son gets worse and worse as he ages. In the meantime, I'm simply existing with no real purpose other than to serve this child like a slave until he turns 18 and do everything for him to keep him alive and well. I don't have much of a future anymore aside from this, and I'm always daydreaming about the things I'd be doing right now if I never had a child.

16 February 2025,A small incident at my son's 16th birthday,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ir1ghd/a_small_incident_at_my_sons_16th_birthday/,"We celebrated my son's 16th birthday today and at some point his father started making stupid jokes about how women get fat and unattractive after having kids. I missed the context, and to be fair, those were just stupid jokes, but I couldn't hold my tongue and replied with my usual response to that - that people just shouldn't have kids, it's a bad idea. I got some disturbed looks from some family members. Someone said that I should keep these thoughts to myself at least on my son's birthday. To which my son said in a sort of aloof tone, that, oh well, my mother is very comfortable sharing her parental regret. To which I said, at least, I must say, I'm glad how well my children turned out despite me. It was all civil and the uncomfortable topic was soon forgotten and we all continued having fun. 

And now that the guests have left, I'm sitting here and just getting angrier and angrier. Now everyone thinks badly of me, while the only thing I did is to make a PSA that if you don't want to be disrespected like that, if you don't want to be treated like used goods, don't have kids!

Now I don't know what to do. I probably should apologise to my son, but at the same time I really don't want to take back what I said, because I fucking mean it. And I probably should say something to my ex husband too.

UPDATE 

I sat down my son and my ex husband, apologised to my son for saying what I said at the party, but explained how I was triggered by his father's stupid remarks, and explained to his father that it was tasteless, not funny, and disrespectful to all women.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

16 February 2025,Tired of having everything snatched from me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iqy18y/tired_of_having_everything_snatched_from_me/,"My 2 year old loves to snatch anything that’s mine. Food/snacks/makeup/school supplies/ shoes/ clothes/money you get the picture.
I’m tired of him stealing my food or snacks or drinks. My water bottle isn’t even mine. My kid and husband drink futon it every single day. For once I want to reach for my water bottle and find it not empty. It’s always empty when I want water and I ALWAYS have to fill it. 
My breakfast is a singular granola bar which my son snatches from me and eats it. So I don’t eat until 5pm most days. I don’t want to cook anymore either bc this kid refuses to eat my food but he’ll eat my separate food that I eat for my diet. But if I give him his own nope he won’t eat it he will only eat mine. Yes I know it’s biology and babies eat mom’s food bc it’s safe. I’m feed up tho. He steals any and everything that is mine and loses it or breaks it. I just for once want something that is mine and just mine. He doesn’t do this to my husband. Oh yeah my husband eats my food too even though he states he doesn’t like it. Then the next morning I see all my v8 energy drinks are gone (I can only tolerate v8 energy drinks, it’s the only one that doesn’t make me feel like shit or give me a migraine). I buy little a bag of chips every other day and don’t eat it all at once. My husband and kid on the other hand eat them in a minute. So I never have my bag of chips. That concludes my rant of being tired of sharing with my son. My son is the one who eats or takes my stuff the most. My husband is meh. Only time I’ve seen my kid take my husband’s stuff is when he buy a big gulp from 7-11 or he has sour cream and onion chips.
PS: this kid has broken over 100 dollars worth of makeup products. I can’t lock my stuff up in a room bc my husband bought those shitty knobs that can be opened from the outside. So my kid can open it.  He can also climb onto the counter of the vanity bc the toilet is right there. Or when I’m late for work I leave my lipstick on my desk and he goes into my room to snatch and break it.",Likely mother: 6 > 0
16 February 2025,PCOS diagnosis should’ve been the first sign,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iqtlkz/pcos_diagnosis_shouldve_been_the_first_sign/,"In my teens I always said I did not want kids. Mostly I don’t mind them when they aren’t mine. I got married in my mid twenties. We had talked about kids and agreed that if we did decide to have any it would be just one, two at most as I’m a middle child and would never do that to a kid. 
After five years I was in my late twenties and got that overwhelming urge of just wanting a baby so badly which I attributed to my biological clock ticking. Coming off birth control, which I’d been on for 10 years at that point, I didn’t have a period… for six months! Kinda hard to start trying if you don’t have a cycle. My doctor referred me to a fertility doctor who verified that I have PCOS. She showed me the pear necklace pattern in my ovaries that indicated a lack of ovulation. My husband and I went to dinner and there I burst into tears apologizing for being ‘defective’ and ‘trapping’ him. He was so supportive saying he didn’t feel that way at all.
I was given  a couple of medications which were unsuccessful, next was Clomid which forced me to ovulate and several months later found out I was pregnant. I was ecstatic because the next step had been IVF.
Unfortunately, I hated being pregnant. When people complimented me saying I was glowing as many do while expecting I’d sarcastically reply that I’d swallowed a glow stick. I am a stomach sleeper so not because my able to made me cranky and uncomfortable. I got a prenatal massage at a place with a belly cutout in the table. I told them they didn’t even have to touch me, just let me lay on my stomach on the special table.
When handed my newborn I felt completely at a loss as to what to do. To this day I swear that the instruction manual was rolled up inside the umbilical cord and it just gets thrown away. Having an infant is tough, I didn’t like it. I see some mothers who are so natural about it they get out and go places, it doesn’t slow them down at all. Not so for me, It felt debilitating. I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything because it was always almost time to nurse the baby or nap time.
As the baby grew to a toddler I didn’t want to play with her when asked. I put her in daycare just to have a break so I could get stuff done and focus on work. This continued into school age using before and after care program. At no point along these years did I enjoy being a mother. When asked if I’d have another I’d say no because with fertility meds it increased the potential for multiples and I would not risk having a middle child.
The first year of middle school kiddo takes the bus home. Meets another kid who introduces her to LGBTQ+ (mind you I’m of the opinion that you do you and I’ll do me) however with this came anxiety and depression so now I’m taking off work constantly for appointments. 
Five years later we’ve had multiple inpatient visit for suicide attempts, tried multiple meds, she is now a he (which is inherently tougher for this age group as they are already trying to fit in). He has severe anxiety, depression, sound sensitivity and these make going out to eat or to a concert impossible. We cannot leave him home alone for fear of additional attempts. 
My marriage is suffering because we get no alone time, after all who hires a ‘babysitter’ for a teenager. I’m so over it. I feel like the initial PCOS diagnosis was a sign that I was not intended to have children and one hundred years ago wouldn’t have been able to. I’ve hated every stage of parenthood so far. It never gets any easier. Don’t get me wrong I love him and will defend him against anyone who disrespects his gender identity choice will spend every penny I have if it will help with his mental health issues. But frankly I wish I’d never had a child in the first place. Does that make me a horrible person?",Likely mother: 3 > 0
16 February 2025,Sick of the bs night feeding habits,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iqoa46/sick_of_the_bs_night_feeding_habits/,"Title says it all... I'm so sick of my newborns night feeding habits and it's going to put me on a grippy sock vacation... 

During the day my newborn has no issues taking his bottle and eating in one whole go then we finish up our routine and he falls asleep until basically next diaper change or feed time. At night though, specifically from anywhere 1am-8am, he wakes up and is just a difficult baby when it comes to eating. The thing is, is that he'll eat from his bottle for maybe a few minutes and then stop completely. REFUSES to continue. At first I thought maybe he would stop eating after a bit because he had gas or was uncomfortable. So I would try to alleviate any of that. Nope, not the issue. He literally will just stop and not want to continue eating. He either falls asleep and I can't get him to wake up or he just stops and will push the bottle away. SO one would think ""Okay you're done eating"" except nothing but a few short minutes later he's screaming and crying because he's hungry and is pissed his bottle went away. Like okay kid, just suck on your damn bottle and finish it just like you do during the day... 

After doing diaper changes, trying to expel any gas or discomfort, it all comes down to that he's hungry and pissed he didn't finish eating. I'm sick of hearing the crying every couple of minutes because he choose to stop eating and refused to continue. Like I can't go back to bed to try to sleep... I just literally sit here like a damn slave waiting for him to start crying again so I can put the bottle back in his mouth so he eats for another few minutes before stopping again... Repeat the process until MAYBE he actually falls asleep for an hour, but by that point I'm dead awake from the constant on and off bottle feeding or it's time that I need to pump so I can't rest. I'm tired and sick of this little game he's playing at night. I'm too tired for this to continue. 

It's currently 4am where we are and he's been on and off this bottle for the past 2 hours and I've done everything else I can to try to just get him to sleep. Ultimately again, he cries and thrashes around showing all hunger cues, but stops every couple of minutes with no progress on the feeding. I'm so tired of this physically and mentally. Like just do what you do during the day! Quit these stupid little night games you're playing.",Unclear: 0 / 0
16 February 2025,The happiest moments of my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iqmxdj/the_happiest_moments_of_my_life/,"The other day I was at an indoor playground with my 3 year old. He’s extremely extroverted, smiley with strangers, and believes that any other kids in the same space are his “friends”. There was a group of four kids, probably between the ages of 3 and 6, who he approached and tried to join in their game. 

After exchanging a few words, the kids suddenly turned on him, telling him to go away, that he’s not their friend, and that they don’t want him to play. It was the first time I had seen that kind of “gang” behaviour in kids so young. I could see my son’s expression change, tears welling up, his face turning red. 

My son doesn’t go to daycare, and we don’t have any extended family or friends with young children. Indoor playgrounds are his main source of interaction with kids of his age, and this was the first time he had been exposed to people treating him like this. He didn’t know how to react - after a stunned pause, he just screamed and screamed until I took him out of the situation. The other kids’ parents were not supervising. 

It’s easy to look at this interaction and see it as a learning experience - personal space, social skills etc. But what I saw was the world taking his innocence and his purity, tearing it to pieces and throwing it to the wind. A child’s utterly pure expectation that the world will offer you kindness, crushed. And I realised that this would happen to him again and again - in school, in work, in love and friendship.

The people you thought were your friends turn out to be otherwise, your work colleagues offer superficial support as they only look out for themselves, the person you thought you loved lets you down again and again. People lie to you, cheat on you, fail to understand you, and it happens to everyone, all over the world, day after day. Think of all the people out there, sitting in front of screens, feeling only frustration and despair because of the behaviours of others.

The weight of watching that happen to my son reminded me of better days. The happiest moments of my life were before he was born. In late 2018, I was walking along a beach with a pack on my back, carrying everything I needed for the week ahead. I had finished my first year of university, it was the summer holidays, and all I had to think about was putting one foot in front of the other until I could set up camp for the night. I watched the waves and the clouds moving across the sky until the sun started to dip below the horizon. I was alone in that vast open space, free, and I felt so unbelievably light.",Unclear: 0 / 0

I’m a ftm to a 10 month old baby girl. Me and my husband didn’t plan for this baby but here she is so we’ve being doing our best for her. My husband never wanted kids but was open to it when I got pregnant. I always thought I’d have one just cause society makes it seem like women are just expected to be moms. I was excited when I was pregnant although I hated pregnancy. Anyway, our daughter is soooo attached to us now. We can’t do anything at all without her crying and screaming. She wants to be held 24/7 and even then sometimes she still isn’t happy. Her sleep has been crap recently and she’s teething. Everyday I just feel overstimulated and out of touch. My husband feels the same but he does still help as much as he can. I feel like this past year has been just…. Not great 😅 I’m so scared for her to be a toddler and be screaming and running around like crazy. I’m considering putting her in full time day care just to stay sane but it’s so expensive in our area and my husband got laid off recently and I only work part time. Some days I like (or tolerate) staying home with her but I just don’t know. Anytime a friend or coworker tells me they are pregnant I struggle to have anything positive to say. I just think oh god good luck with that 🥲 it doesn’t help that our parents are the type to say “all babies are such a blessing” and want us to have 4 or 5. We can never complain about the baby to them, they think babies are perfect and do no wrong!! This is just a rant. If anyone read this thank you 🙃",Likely mother: 8 > 0
15 February 2025,Happy Valentines to me,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ipptyt/happy_valentines_to_me/,"The pot that has been brewing in my house has boiled over once again. This time between my son and I. 

Some backstory: son is Homeschooled and I WFH. Currently my husband is out for the count due to many medical reasons and he has surgery 3 of 4 Monday. I wrote before about how my son wasn’t taking his medication and I had to take over to make sure he took them. 

After meeting with his guidance counselor I’ve found out since the new semester he’s attending approximately 30% of his classes. So if I’m home holding him to it he goes to class- if I leave him alone for any reason he doesn’t go to class. And he’s been using work as an excuse to not go to class (to the point where his boss said if he couldn’t bring his grades up he would be fired). Today he had no live classes but most of the weeks assignments to complete and I had errands to run out of the house so I told him I expected everything to be done by 4 as I go in at 430  and if it wasn’t I was blocking his internet. So he decided while I was out of the house to walk to the comic book shop and run around town shopping. When I got home he was out at McDonald’s with his sister - ok cool I pull up his school work it’s half done it was before 4 so I said ok maybe it’s something quick and he will knock it out we will have a conversation about getting shit done before he leaves the house - he strolls in after 4 saying oh I still have ABC to do. I said not tonight you don’t your internet is locked until tomorrow morning and you have until noon to get it done or I will be locking the internet. He exploded to say the least he called his case manager (he has a whole team of ppl helping him with school, therapy and peer support) and tells her that I’m denying him his meds and he can’t focus at school. Mind you I’m in constant contact with his team so she called me bc she told him he’s not in crisis he is dealing with the consequences of his actions and that he needs to take accountability for what happened. She then called me and told me what was said and was concerned about him bc they talked last week and he was blaming everyone in the house for why his grades were slipping. So I called him in the room and I asked him what was up and he exploded again pretty much upset it was my fault that he was failing (don’t ask me how bc he could not give any reason why it was my fault).  He then began to pretty much say that he’s a slave in the house and I do nothing for him or his sister (while he’s using the internet I pay for bc hubby’s not working, or the cell phone he has that I pay for…). His case worker tried to redirect him multiple times telling him he’s getting off topic bc what he perceives what I do or don’t do doesn’t change HE didn’t do what he was supposed to do. 

I’m just over it. My husband is not working and unable to take care of himself so it falls to me. My daughter is finally doing what she should be doing but he’s pissed bc he’s not getting what he wants.  I’m just over it. Days like today just remind me why I scream at my sister to stay child free.",Likely mother: 2 > 0

But stupidly got married to the wrong person, but had 2 beautiful healthy kids. 1 boy and 1 girl. Me and my then husband just did not do life well at all. I ended up leaving him and moving In with my mom with the 2 kids. He never really wad involved and hasnt been then or now and I worked alot at the time and regretfully paid more attention to my career than parenting. If I could go back i would change how I did so many things but the reality Is I can't but also it's never too late I want this to work so badly.. so at this time to get the story clear I didn't abandon my kids at all, I still came home cooked dinner, read them books bath time and bed routine
 Then I'd be off to work in the morning before they would wake up... well 8 years passed and my mother just recently died. God bless her soul, what a beautiful being she was. 

My issue is due to my absenteeism from working, my kids don't listen to me, don't respect me, all they want to do is be on their phone.. how can I change this? How do I get them to take me seriously. I want nothing more than for all of us to be a happy family and respect each other.. but it has to be a team effort or it won't work.. I'm the sole provider of my household and it's so much stress on my shoulders I have to work or else we would be homeless.

For me I'm honestly doing the best I can, this life is rough tho.. does it ever get any easier???

Before having a child, me and my partner had an amazing life: we both worked and had the money to travel a lot, my mental health was stable, and we were thriving as a couple. I couldn't of been happier. We used to spend every waking moment with one another and barely argued. We would go out for dinners, talk and laugh until the early hours of the morning, and simply loved experiencing life together. Having this much love for one another meant we obviously tried for a baby, and I got pregnant two months after stopping birth control. Pregnancy was hard and I didn't enjoy it, but the newborn stage was easier than I expected and I probably enjoyed this stage more than any other. But then the toddler stage happened... The whining all day everyday, the tantrums that can't be resolved, the picky eating and the constant mess.. It's all too much for me, and on top of this, my relationship is falling a part. I am so miserable from dealing with my toddler all day that all I do is complain, which causes me and my partner to argue because he hates the fact I'm so negative. I cant leave the house because we live in the middle of no where and I don't have the money for travel, so most days are spent at home where I usually have multiple breakdowns a day because my toddler simply won't stop demanding, whining, and then on the nights he won't sleep so I'm also sleep deprived and have no time for intimacy with my partner. Furthermore, due to my anxiety being so high throughout the day, on the nights I usually crumble and eat my feelings: consuming thousands of calories in one sitting because the sensation of eating lots of food fills the void and distracts me from the fact my toddler is most likely not going to sleep again and this nightmare is just going to continue all over again. I've gained so much weight to the point I hate looking at myself. I used to have abs, and now I have flab and nothing fits right. I look at myself and hate what I see, which causes me to feel even more depressed so then I eat more. It's a never ending cycle, and if I could go back, I would tell my younger self to not bother having a child, and to focus on my relationship instead.

14 February 2025,I hate my newborn,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iozv8l/i_hate_my_newborn/,"Long post... I'm trying out this page to discuss/vent about how I feel right now because I will loose myself completely if I can't find a place to voice what's going on in my head.

My fiancé has always wanted to be a dad. He's always wanted a large family and I really thought I wanted to be a mom and to give him that large family. I think this is probably where the biggest issue in our relationship will be as honestly up until now, we really have never had any issues and our relationship felt very strong and secure. I love him so much and I love us and who we are as a couple, and honestly I feel like having this baby just completely ruined that. My fiancé and I just had our first child 2 weeks ago. I will say throughout the whole pregnancy I really struggled with finding a connection to the baby. It just seemed like it wasn't real, and then when I could finally feel things like kicks and movement, it just felt like I had a parasite living in me. I hate feeling movement in my body, it just made me feel gross and not like a human. I would say mental health wise, I really struggled through pregnancy.

My fiancé was soooo excited and happy that I was happy to be holding him and just in awe with this little human immediately after birth. He was really worried I wouldn't connect with the baby or even want the baby after birth. A few hours after birth the happiness and excitement wore off and I honestly just became numb. It was like a doom hit me and I realized that my life was never going to be the same and it upset me because quite honestly, I loved my life before pregnancy. I had a successful business of 4 years going (dog training career), I was working with my dogs and other peoples dogs and I loved it. I truly LOVED caring for my dogs and working with other peoples dogs.

Now getting home with this baby I haven't had time at all for any of my dogs. It sucks because with my business/career literally being centered around dogs and training, working my dogs on the daily was something I did and loved to do. Now it's like, I'm trying to sleep, eat, exclusively breast pump, bottle feed my baby, and change them I have no time for anything else. People will tell me that my baby will grow up and I'll have time again, but right now it's just the baby stage of things so it's going to be busy like that. Like cool, this baby will likely live until they're in their 80's, the dogs I own now will only be on this earth from anywhere from 5-10 years. I want to enjoy and spend that time with them and continue that relationship with them. Not with some newborn that all they do is cry, scream, piss, shit, and eat. To me, it's been way more fulfilling in my life to work with dogs than it has been to be a parent so far. I genuinely think if someone forced me to choose the life of my newborn or my dogs, I would choose my dogs (go ahead and hate me now for saying it).

My partner had just started his new job 1 month before we had the baby so he doesn't get paid leave for the baby and still has to work. My small business, though small, was the main breadwinner between us and I've had to put that business on hold to obviously care for this baby. It honestly just makes me more resentful by the day. I hate being the one at night waking up and tending to this baby which I know my fiancé would wake up in a heartbeat if I woke him, but considering he has to wake up at 5:30am for work and then doesn't get home until 4:40pm, days are LONG for him and I don't want to risk him falling asleep at the wheel on the way home.

Honestly every time I need to do any interaction with this baby, it just feels like an eye roll... Like fuck just let me please hurry to figure out what this baby wants so he stops screaming and crying. Changing this baby, holy shit, I for the life of me, cannot stand him. All he does is scream the entire time, kick, try rolling, flailing his arms, and it's damn near impossible to get him to stop. For eating he'll start eating and fall asleep within minutes. It's impossible to wake him back up to finish eating, so then I have to wait for him to wake back up after 10 minutes or so on his own and start fussing again. This whole little routine of his takes him forever to finish a bottle and then of course, he'll just wake up in an hour or so and start the whole damn process again so I get no sleep what so ever. Again, my husband works and his hours are terrible so I don't want him to be up during the night dealing with this. During the day, he'll sleep literally all day... So sleep when the baby sleeps, is what people say, but I cannot for the life of me fall asleep during the day time.

Since having the baby, my fiancé continues to talk about our future and having more babies soon. I think he truly believes I'm happy when in reality I'm not even anywhere in the same stratosphere of the definition of the word, happy. If something happened where my fiancé wasn't in the picture any longer, I would give this baby up for adoption immediately. I'm only sticking this out with a smile on my face for him and because I know it's not this baby's fault that I just have zero feelings towards him... I'm adopted and was given up into the adoption system 3 days after I was born, I'm wondering if my birth mom maybe felt the same way about me. To which, if so, I'm glad she gave me up to a family where I was wanted so she didn't have to feel the need to fake it. I feel like I've sacrificed every single thing about myself for this baby. A huge sacrifice with no return in my opinion... I'm hoping the future will be different as the baby grows up, but it also scares me because my fiancé wants more children and I just for the life of me can't see myself doing this again. I know in the past he's mentioned that not having a large family is a deal breaker for him. I genuinely thought I would like being a parent more than I do now... But maybe this is just not going to work between us? And if that's the case, where does that leave the child because he's too busy with his job to care for a baby and I certainly don't want it. Of course right now I'm doing everything in my power to work through everything I'm going through to make this work for us and this family, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't feeling like each day I was dying a bit more inside.

Please don't give me any medication or seek therapy advice. While I'm sure those types of remedies are great for some people, they just aren't ones that I personally find helpful as I've tried. I can't stand comments about how it should be as simple as going to therapy and that therapy will fix things as if it's that easy... I also don't need comments saying my partner needs to do more. When he's not working, or going to sleep for work, he takes over caring for the baby and does what he can with the time he has. It's just super unfortunate that that he started this job right before having the baby to where legally, his employer does not have to give him leave any leave at all (yes even unpaid leave).

**Update:**   
**Read the tag!! No advice!!** If you have something to say that's kind, nonjudgemental, and validating then please share your stories and comments. But if you're going to give advice where unwarranted that's rude and judgmental as well as making assumptions, then refrain yourself please. Thank you",Likely mother: 4 > 1

I’ll be 27 on the 18th and I don’t think I’ve been more depressed in my life. My partner is immature, manipulative, abusive mentally and physically and unappreciative but won’t let me go because his ego can’t take the L. I hope this doesn’t sound conceited.. but I guess let’s say I am far out of his league beyond just looks and I settled because at the time I had just come out of some very difficult life circumstances that my mom orchestrated and was kinda just flying off the handle and didn’t care how my life went. I turned 21 had a few fun nights and boom. Pregnant. Just like that I had no idea how over my life really was. And I had baby no.2 because I was an only child and now an orphan and I figured.. well worst comes to worst if I don’t “make it” he won’t be alone in the world like I am. But now ironically I’m even more attractive than I was before I had kids just like not woman and stuff and I’m more physically confident, I am able to work out occasionally so I pour a lot of my frustration into that but it feels like there’s nothing I can do with it. I used to do acting and modeling jobs for a few years before motherhood and I loved it. It gave me new life and I know that it’s not a career path that’s guaranteed, but the fact I just. Let it go for this… just eats at me away constantly. And in an effort to not give up completely on some semblance of that idea I thought now that I am a pretty decent gamer I wanted to start streaming because I know even as a girl like I don’t have to be AMAZING at the game for people to watch and who knows I could end up making some money and having a job I don’t absolutely loathe. I also have always wanted to do cosplay. Can’t because this insecure dipshit is constantly worried about men trying to get at me. I hate my life.

I always wanted to be a mom growing up but I did plan to go to college and work in education. I accidently got pregnant at 18 and had my first son. I adored him so much I was blinded from how hard being a parenting actually was and the long term consequences.  I immedately asked my now husband if we could get married and we allowed ourselves to have more kids (we never tried to get pregnant and used the pull out method but I was just very fertile). We justified each new baby, saying it would be good for our children to have siblings. I really can't rationalize why I allowed myself to have 5 kids because I am now so overwhelmed after doing the parenting thing for 16 years and being nowhere near done. Unfortunatly, I've become more depressed and lonely over the years from the draining nature of parenting. No one in my life can understand why I had multiple kids and I guess they were overwhelmed by it too so our family and friends began to distance themselves from me. Obviously having many kids is a big responsiblity so I decided to be a SAHM despite being an intelligent and disciplined person. I now feel terrible about myself that after over a decade into my adult life, I'm still just a SAHM with no career. So many women and mom's work now and I get so anxious and depressed because I have no idea what career I could handle while also trying to manage my 5 kids schedules and all the housework (my husband helps a litlte but he has his own challenges trying to provide for all of us). I grew up wanting to be a teacher but parenting has really made me question if I would want to be in a classroom all day and then come home to housework and my own kids. I often have thoughts that if I had only had my oldest son and daughter, my life could be very different and a lot more manageable. My oldest kids are in high school already, meanwhile my youngest just started kindergarten. But then I feel so guilty because my youngest 3 kids are really great humans and I love them.. my youngest son in particular shows me so much love and I feel guility because I'm just so exhaused to do this parenting thing right with each of them. I also suffer from being alone so much but I'm so bad at making friends... I never really learned how to do adult relationships since I've been too busy being a mom.",Likely mother: 6 > 0

How do you talk to your partner about your parental regret? today I told my spouse, “I wish I had known how badly I didn’t want kids.” This comment, of course, did not help. Are we only to air our grievances here? I have not found a community of parents IRL who care to talk about regret at all, and my spouse certainly finds it toxic, which I understand.

Maybe I just need to vent. We had our first son at 32, good jobs, financially stable. Immediately moved into a terrible house simply to ensure he’d be in a good school district. At about 3, we knew something was awry. He was desperately needy, clingy, and unbearably loud. Screamed and shrieked all day. We had him diagnosed and he came back ADHD and on the spectrum. Sounds like the Onion article, but we had two couples confide that he was the reason they decided not to have kids. My parents can’t stand being around him and we couldn’t find a babysitter willing to put up with him more than once.

He’s now 13 and it’s not any better. His days are spent vocal stimming — “skibbity skibbity hawk tuah” at the top of his lungs. He spends far too much time on screens but it’s hard to restrict the one thing that distracts him. Horrible student. Doesn’t care about grades, pleasing teachers, etc. we’ve spent tens of thousands of dollars on therapists, camps, workshops, vacations, school counseling, IDP, sports, swimming, piano lessons…nothing matters. It’s just a daily routine of him waking up at 6 am, screaming, demanding we wake up too, and screaming and stimming and shrieking. 

I’m spent. I see other couples with lovely children that can actually have lunch at a restaurant without intentionally spilling their water and kicking my shins to get my attention. My wife and I have no intimacy anymore — we are too tired — and we both acknowledge that it’s not healthy that we plow through two bottles of wine a night to cope. And then I go on Instagram seeing our childless friends lounging on beaches in countries we can’t afford to visit. At least anymore.

This is just a vent. But god, my parents had it easy. On weekends I’d run out into the neighborhood and hang out with my friends while they did whatever they wanted. And for the last 13 years, my weekends have been spent planning activities for a kid who is mainly interested in screaming me awake at 6 am, spilling his drink in my car, complaining about the zoo being boring, and kicking the back of my seat on the way home.

Yeah had my parents (and brothers/sis in laws) been not so religious and conservative ugh. Had my beautiful now ex boyfriend not been an alcoholic, if we had had support idk. If my daughter could have been younger seeing us go thru that supprt. At 12 and already almost all the way through puberty too it feels like.. it's too late (he was too strict but also too unavailable and I too permissive but I am glad we had so much physical affection and still sometimes do? Tonight not so much 😢).
I wish I had a true like... community.. that wasn't religious lol that I could have raised her in. I knew deep down too in my 20s etc. (Had her at 21) that I got lucky with an extremely easy baby and then I was maybe being too permissive at times and same with my parents (🙄 who should have really known even better).. and she did have such a fun/funny/good personality. I mean and to be fair still generally does! I'm literally like. Praying I get lucky and this is a phase maybe from 10/11 to say 15. But what am I saying? Ugh. I should have been better before. Fast forward to It's been a lot this year me just going through a break up (she's happy about seemingly) and her being soo busy in 6th grade at this school that has me driving quite the little distance to.. I might make my parents drive her in the mornings next year. With my kind of awful but at least conveniently working from home and makes enough $$$ job.... I want to start my day more peaceful.

I'm so alone, and fat, old and ugly, poor and miserable, no career, no passions, no hobbies, no future, and on top of it all I'm riddled with guilt for being a bad wife and mom. No one told me the truth and I was tricked, I didn't need any of this trauma.

But I am indeed a very regretful parent in general.  If I start taking meds, does it help with my mood swings and stress of dealing with my toddler everyday?  Is it worth it?

He’s amazing. When I was pregnant with him (planned btw ik silly of me then to think I could handle this) my husband was up for staff in the USAF and I was just starting at my job with the state (that I still currently have). Almost right when I got pregnant, my husband start going out just abt every other night, usually not home until 1 am. He called me early of the nights saying he tried a certain substance (not legal in the Air Force and I’m not sure if I’m allowed to say it here) and that he had a head ache and wanted to stay otp w me until he got home. He was drug tested 2 days later. The offered him a deal that he would do 30 days in prison and then leave the USAF with other than honorable discharge and not on his record. He was discharged a couple days after our son was born. Since then, he has lost several jobs, has had 2 cars repossessed (one he got back) and has now just recently lost ANOTHER job. I’m so over it. I don’t have anywhere else to go bc of my not so great relationship with my parents and being a mother has been EXHAUSTING. There are fun moments and I love him so much, but being financially buried and fighting every day with this man over it is killing me. I have no help whatsoever, the house is a mess 24/7. I’m constantly anxious that I’m messing my baby up and I hate myself for it. My body is so much bigger than what it used to be and I can’t lose it no matter how hard I try (I’m 200lbs now, used to be 170) and I’m killing myself trying to survive every day.

I had my child at 26 and she is 6 now. She was conceived during a hypomanic episode and dad is not in the picture.  I suffered from a severe episode/ burnout for two years around 2021, and was officially diagnosed with bipolar II at age 31. I would say I was a good parent before 2021. But ever since, my relationship with my child has changed. 


Day to day life is hard for me. It feels like I barely know how to take care of myself, and I have to take care of her on top of it. We have developed so many bad habits because I’m just not functioning like I used to. We eat like garbage, screen time is too high, etc. I don’t know how to function without these crutches. I want to be better and I just don’t know how. 


Some days are better than others. On hard days, I do catch myself wishing it was only me I had to look after. I fear that I shouldn’t have become a parent, that she deserves more. I have such a long way to go to achieve independence ( we live with family) and it feels daunting to think I’m the “ adult”. I don’t wish she was gone, I just wish I was a better person. I wish I could handle life better.

I constantly feel like i’m talking to a brick wall. She doesn’t listen to a single thing I say. Trying to change her pull ups or get her dressed is a mission on its own. She will cry, kick, fling herself back, and bite. 
I cant go into another room without her whinging and following me. As soon as she sees me trying to do something, she will fake cry and whinges to try to get my attention.  
I’m exhausted. Her dad complains about being tired but he doesn’t do much when it comes to our daughter, unfortunately. Although he works 4pm to 12am, but also goes to bed late on nights off and naps every day. He will play with her and try to be the parent when she’s in trouble, but i’m the default parent by default and I hate it. I’m the one that disciplines, does bath time, makes decisions, organises meals at meal times, cleans up after her, does bed time, organises her for the day, wakes up 10x in the night from her (crawling into bed with me, kicking in sleep ect), i’m the one she’s goes to for everything, plus I start work early in the mornings with all that on top. 
I’m just so overwhelmed that the idea of packing the car and just driving away, looks so good.

My twins are less than 6 months away of turning 15 and the one thing on this list was teens should be able to take medication on their own. 

Whoever wrote this article didn’t think of teens with ADHD. Trying to get my kids to consistently take their meds is like trying to collect water in a colander. I’m over every few months my kids deciding that their meds aren’t working so they are just going to stop taking them. This morning I found three bottles of meds in my son’s room half taken (daughter is currently taking hers but bc she gets violent I monitor it closely).  Then the argument with him bc he’s been so nasty lately so when I refilled them I was like I don’t believe you are taking them regularly so I’m going to dispense them. After a week his mood has definitely improved but when I found the meds automatically fighting saying they don’t work anymore so I stopped taking them (after swearing all week he had been taking them).

My seven-year-old daughter has been getting bullied at school. This week alone she has had three incidents which have involved two separate children. Being hit, punched in the stomach and then having a child spit in her hair. 
The school is trying to resolve the incidents and I am trying to cooperate with them as best as possible. 

The emotional stress that it has brought at home dealing with my daughter who is obviously very distressed hasn’t been easy. I am struggling because my daughter won’t open up to me. 

I am a single mum and the default parent, I am the parent that has to deal with the day-to-day life of organising two children, running a household and juggling a business. 

Call me cruel, but situations like this make me more regrettable about becoming a parent. The stress and worry of your children in this world just doesn’t go away. I hate it. I wish I could turn back the clock. I wish I never had children so then they never have to endure any pain in this world. It is soul destroying!

If you look back at previous posts you will see me opening up on my struggles as being the default, single mum. I hate it! I hate this life I have created. Being young, stupid and naive not thinking how having children would truly impact my own life but that of my children. Not being emotionally, mentally, physically or financially ready has taken its toll. 

People in my daily life try to reassure me that I should be grateful to have two beautiful and healthy daughters. I’ll never understand how the small and happy moments of being a parent outweigh the huge responsibility, the never-ending work and the constant stress.

07 February 2025,I regret having my second kid,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ijs5bi/i_regret_having_my_second_kid/,"There, I've said it out loud.

My daughter is 25 months old, was planned, happily welcomed into the world and I've had so much fun with her doing swimming classes, play groups, singing groups and all that stuff. 

Eleven days before her first birthday I held a positive pregnancy test in my hands.

I cried for weeks because I didn't feel ready to give up my alone time with my daughter yet. My husband was pretty chill and way happier than me. We wanted to have two kids someday and now it was happening way earlier than anticipated. I've read all the good stuff about 2u2 like everyone out of diapers at almost the same time, same interests for the kids, a build in best friend so close in age and all that stuff.

The months passed by, I gave my all to my daughter to give her the best of time with me. We've started nursery when she was 18 months old (because I've enrolled her months before I knew I was pregnant because I wanted to return to my job) and like two weeks before the baby arrived she was spending 4h + 2h nap there so I had time to focus on the baby. I was so scared of the changes but everyone told me we would be fine.

Now it's five months later and I absolutely hate everything. The baby is overall a pretty chill dude but his sleeping is exhausting. By day he only sleeps in the carrier (car seat only when we're driving, everything else 30 minutes max) and at night he only sleeps in my arms or on my chest. I am so overtouched I want to cry. He wants to be carried around the entire day and is almost never happy just lying around and watching me play with his sister. And she hates him. She hates that he's so close to me the entire day and even though I try to carry them both at the same time sometimes it's exhausting (together they're about almost 45 lbs) but she doesn't want him with her. She pinches his head, pulls his clothes and pushes him away the second his hands or feet touch something that belongs to her. Everyone around seems to have baby loving toddlers (sibling or just other people's babies) but not my daughter. There are some silver linings like she trying to give him a bottle or a pacifier when he's crying but I think that's mostly because she's annoyed by him. Her favourite sentence is translatable to putting him in the bin because he's trash.

And me? I feel nothing for him. He's here so of course I care for him, feeding, changing, smiling, interacting, carrying around obviously but I just do it because I have to. He's basically a potato keeping me away from my daughter I love spending time with. I dread leaving the house with both of them because it's exhausting and when I leave the baby with my husband I feel guilty that I don't want to spend time with the baby more. I have zero patience for him crying at night and I also have no energy left to be patient with my daughter. She's just a toddler and of course she acts out and tests her boundaries but I am so easily annoyed by her and I feel horrible about that. I just can't give her what she needs because I have to care for a baby I don't want to care for. Hell I can't even bend down to play with her when he's asleep because he'd wake up.

I've once read on the 2u2 subreddit that if you can be the best parent for one kid but not for two you shouldn't have two. Before I had kids I thought I could give all of me to two kids but now I know that I can't. I can't be the parent I want to be for two kids right now and everyone is suffering from that.

I'm pretty sure I have PPD but it's fucking impossible to find a therapist with free slots for new patients in my country. And even if I find some energy to invest into the search for one I can't really make appointments because we're all sick like every other week with some damn flu, RSV, hand mouth food or whatever. So yes technically my daughter is in daycare half the day but when sick she's at home of course and even when she's out of the house I get nothing done because of the baby sleeping in the carrier. I feel like all I can do is to wait for the weather to be better so we're not sick all the time and leaving the house isn't so much work with dressing everyone and the baby to be older and more fun and independent. I hope there will come the day I look back to this days and say ""I'm so happy I did that"" and the kids being best friends or whatever. 

My husband tries to help and is around a lot during the day (works self employed from home) but my daughter doesn't want him around her except for playing with Duplo for like half an hour and he has back problems he never cared for but they prevent him taking the baby into the carrier and I don't want him to sleep with the baby at night because he's a heavy smoker without real plans to quit some time soon. It's okay for me to do more with the kids, the social system in my country allows me to be a SAHM for two years but I am just so fucking exhausted. I just wish we didn't have this stupid one unprotected sex that night but of course it's our own fault, noone else to blame, especially not the baby.

 Toddlerhood is next to torture though. And my oldest just got out of that stage and I am hopeful for parent-child relationship to develop stronger. Cause up until now I low key hated him, but I also hate his dad and that mightve carried through.

My third ( the 18 month old) is hell. Torture. I loathe him. I resent him. He is typical toddler behavior x100000.  Even as a baby he was the highest needs of them all. He was colic. Couldn’t go anywhere because he hated the car seat, breastfeeding didn’t go well because ALL he wanted to do was be on the boob. He is so high energy, so loud, doesn’t ever just sit and play with a toy. Destroys anything and everything he can get his hands on. Does everything he’s not suppose to do and I don’t know how we haven’t ended up in the emergency room from climbing things to putting everything and anything in his mouth

My 4th baby is pretty chill and I don’t even get to enjoy him because I’m so fucking overstimulated from #3 and everyone else. I’ve never enjoyed breastfeeding my other kids until our 4th and he’s a great nurser. But my third child has ruined it for me. I have to constantly get up from nursing to get him down / out of stuff, or stuff out of his mouth. I get so tense and uptight when he’s loud while I’m nursing. I feel like I’m being pushed towards formula because it’s so hard to manage him while nursing and I resent him for it. Our house is an open concept 1800 sq ft ranch and we’ve had to try and gate off half our house to keep him somewhat safe while I nurse… which it doesn’t make that much a difference. 

I loathe the start of everyday, countdown the hours / minutes until he naps , but on edge the entire time loathing when he will wake up. The moment I hear his cries, I just want to cry myself. It leaves me in a nasty mood for everyone else to experience. The rage that runs through me is unbearable. It absolutely doesn’t help that I’m not on my adhd meds. I tried taking them but they tanked my milk supply and seemed to make baby fussy, so I’ve been trying to do without so I can continue nursing because I feel it’s the only break I get when my husbands home, but idk how much more I can take. 

My husband is great support. His job is flexible and he can work from home as needed. He’s always home on Fridays and pretty much takes care of the 3 older kids in the evenings and weekends. .

05 February 2025,I feel so sorry for my son,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ii49vr/i_feel_so_sorry_for_my_son/,"When I look at my son, I feel so sorry for him. He never asked for this life and he never asked for this world. I feel sorry for myself too, for having the hubris and arrogance to think that bringing him here was the right choice. It is no wonder that birth rates are dropping rapidly throughout the Western world. But I also want to talk about how regret might be able to make us better parents. 

Our society isn't set up for us to achieve happiness - it's set up to keep the gears turning, so the 1% can continue to maintain their position while the rest of us struggle through each day. We are forced to perform in school, perform in work, to never stop producing. We get stressed out, we get physically and mentally unhealthy. And for what? To afford the basics that should be owed to us as human beings - secure food and shelter - under the threat of hunger and homelessness? 

Both parents need to work to pay off a mortgage (or rent for that matter). God help you if you are a single parent. Gold help you if you have a child with special needs. The cost of everything, including medical care, is going up so quickly. There is no safety net. Parents have no access to a close-knit community and 90% of the responsibility for child rearing outside of working hours falls on them. Business and government commercialize parenting and children during work hours through daycare. 

Then what happens? Your child gets sick constantly, forcing you to take time off work because day care won't accept them. And of course, your work isn't set up for regular absences - your sick leave is limited and before you know it, you are just paying for daycare you almost never get to use. You start to take unpaid leave. You stay at home and try in vain to soothe an unhappy child. Then your job security is in jeopardy. 

It's too late for me, I made a mistake and now I have to deal with the regret and reality of raising a child in this society. But for other childless people - don't have a child. No more bodies being forced into lifelong labor, no more stress and mental illness that are a product of our system and culture, no more feeding lives into toxic and ineffective politics, war, extinction, and economic instability. Not having kids is the most subversive thing we can do.

But when I look at my son and feel sorry for him, and I think about what the world looks like, I feel a very deep sense of compassion. This innocent little boy, who never asked to be here, struggling to just be a human, who will go on to struggle through school and work and relationships as we all are forced to do. The regret is so real, the burden is so heavy, and future is so frightening. But if we let ourselves feel it, I think that compassion can make us better parents.",Unclear: 0 / 0
04 February 2025,Special needs children,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ihbooo/special_needs_children/,"Another day where I cry in public due to my daughter's behavior humiliating me. I've cried many times over the years, several in public and I don't cry easily. I can't take her in public, not even for 2 mins. I'm constantly on edge and so anxious. Occasionally she is well behaved but it's such a gamble. When she has a meltdown or starts acting up I just die inside, in fact I literally want to die. And I will leave. I have left after paying for food before I can eat it, I've left right after paying entry somewhere, left in the middle of some show etc etc. Has any other parent been embarrassed more times than me? Why do I never see other children having tantrums in public? People must think that I'm a shit parent that doesn't discipline. Well it's the furthest from the truth, I've tried everything for nearly 5 years (including multiple disappointing therapies) and no one else in my family can control her either. I hate that I can't let her be a normal child and that she has to miss out on things and I have to miss out on being a normal parent doing normal things with my child. Unfortunately I still have to take her to occasional medical appointments as that's essential, plus school which she just started.

I wish I could find parents of special needs kids who REALLY struggle like me. Even on reddit there's nothing. Those subreddits are barely active and it's just people asking questions, not a support group. Wish I could find other special needs parents who are miserable and depressed cause I feel so alone and no one knows what this is like. I can't talk to people with normal kids about this, they can't relate. I've been to playgroups in the past for kids who had the same disability and never met any child who had delays or problems because of it. Every child was usually less 'disabled' than my child.

For the record my child has a physical disability and what I wonder is severe ADHD but no diagnosis yet.",Unclear: 0 / 0

The problem is that me being an introvert I just sometimes really need my time and space and I get easily overstimulated. The problem is that my child is glued to me 24/7 (outside school and time spent with other caregivers). Either they won’t stop talking to me or they keep cuddling me to the point I feel uncomfotable and want to scream “just leave me the f*uck alone!!” (Never did but I was close many times believe me). They even require sleeping with me at their age (husband forced to stay in the guest bedroom - we don’t mind having separate bedrooms as he snores a lot) but honestly the way they fall asleep - literally glued to me. My personal space and integrity is non-existent ever since I’ve became a mother. I dream of child free beach holidays (went on a holiday a month ago, no rest as I was just a watchdog and a playtime buddy most of the times). I dream of going snowboarding with my childfree brother and friends. I am so jealous of my childree friends. I envy their carefree lives, having to take care of themselves only. I envy my boomer and gen x colleagues at work with adult or young adult children. My motherhood stole half of my 20s and I’m still waiting to be finally free and independent but fear it will never come. Mind you I have ONE child. ONE.

I never wanted them. He would accuse me of being selfish, mean, self centered and a terrible person for wanting to be autonomous. And since I loved him...I thought, well maybe he is right. And eventhough I knew I wanted nothing to do with kids. I went thru with unprotected sex and getting off birth control regretting every second of it. 

My daughter was conceived and I was terrified. And scheduled 2 abortions but missed them because my ex kept threatening me. 

Anyways, I ended up being home with my kids for 5 years, my second was conceived 2 years later another story. Which essentially was rape. 

I've shared custody with my exhusvand now for 9 years and each time I see my kids my energy is drained and sapped.

03 February 2025,How to deal with worsening behavior in 2.5 year old.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1igooy0/how_to_deal_with_worsening_behavior_in_25_year_old/,"I have posted frequently in here before. My son is 2.5, and he's undiagnosed. I have suspected he's on the spectrum since he was a baby because he cried literally all the time even after getting his needs met. And now he's growing into a very unhappy boy who is upset and whines/cries all day for any or no reason. That's his default setting.

Well, these past few months his behavior has gotten noticeably worse. He now doesn't listen to me at all. And I mean I cannot get him to listen on anything so I have to force him into doing things. I can't get him to learn how to use the potty because he won't listen to me, but yet he hates diaper changes so he kicks me, slaps me, bites me, tries to throw my glasses across the room, etc. My husband and I both have to physically restrain him. This is how we have to do for everything else: getting him ready for daycare, every single diaper change, meal times, bath time, and especially bed time. He walks around with long finger and toe nails because he physically fights us and won't let us touch him. 

I took a parenting class through my university and none of their tips have worked. They practice a lot of gentle parenting. None of that works with my son. Like I said, he doesn't listen to me at all anymore. He won't even respond to me when I call out his name.

I have tried time out, bribing with treats and snacks, gentle talk, hugging him while he's having a meltdown (this seems to make it worse so I stopped), talking softly and saying things like ""I know you're upset right now..."" Legit nothing works.

I know a lot of you struggle with your kids' behaviors, too. What do you do to get your kid to listen to you? I need quick and easy to implement tactics for the day to day. I don't have time to read books, and I almost always fall asleep when reading.  

I want to add that my kid behaves better for other people. I have not received complaints about his behavior from the daycare.  It could be they are not sharing information with me. But, I would think that if he's kicking and biting the teachers, like he does with me, that they would have said something by now.

03 February 2025,I miss when we were childless and both had corporate jobs and a “normal” schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1igl1fi/i_miss_when_we_were_childless_and_both_had/,"My husband really hated his corporate job with passion which is why he ended up becoming self employed after he was let go from his last job.  This was shortly after we got married, and the job he currently has is his second businesss after selling his first one.  I had to be supportive of his decision because I loved him and certainly didn’t want him to be unhappy with his work or his pay, but I honestly just wish he had stayed.  I recently became a SAHM but I was always a corporate worker.  I didn’t love it but I just stuck out because it gave us stable income and health insurance.   The reason why I am posting on this sub is because I think his job wouldn’t have bothered or affected me at all if we never had a child.  We were both very independent people who enjoyed doing couple things together whenever we wanted.  Now that such flexibility is gone and our lives are so much dependent on caring for our toddler, I am so resentful.  His current job is an independent contractor who drives a truck to deliver stuff and he needs to go to bed at 8pm every single night to leave for work around 3:30am.   He is always on the road, busy as hell, and doesn’t come home until around 3-5pm, depending.  He never really has an off day except 1-2 days a week where he only works in the morning and comes back home around 10am-ish.  But back to going to bed at 8pm.  I never knew I would hate this kinda schedule so much.  I understand the need to sleep super early due to having to go to work that early but it still doesn’t really work for me.  I really miss having looked forward each day to catch up and watch shows together with him after our daughter was asleep and we will never have that anymore.  It was really difficult and lonely the couple of months after he started this job.  It was really bad to the point I felt really depressed and very much alone everyday being stuck with our toddler all day with a husband who was now pretty much unavailable right when I needed him.  I missed his presence so much everyday and was very sad that he was either asleep, or in so much pain and fatigue all the time from his job which was physically demanding and time consuming.  After the first couple of months, I found myself getting more and more used to it which was a good thing in a way, but it was kinda sad because I no longer needed him as much and actually found much comfort being alone, especially during my free time after our daughter was asleep.  My low sex drive post partum got even lower after this experience and these days, I have none to the point where I dread those days where our daughter happens to nap while my husband is home.  I just resent him for expecting those times to be our sex time when all he pretty much does is work or play on his phone (instead of spending some quality time with our daughter during the short time he is home). I guess I am just resentful at him, at this situation, and the fact that I lost my freedom by deciding to have a kid.  I don’t think this weird schedule would have bothered me so much if we were childless because that would just mean a lot of alone time for me (which I love) as well as spending time with him during the early evenings most days.  I just miss going to bed with him at night like normal people, having sex at night, coming back home in the evening to chill out and going places on weekends and long Holidays like normal people.  Ever since he started this new job, he sleeps in the bedroom while I sleep with our toddler just so he can sleep uninterrupted at 8pm.

I hate saying that because now it feels like I’d be getting rid of this fully formed human being. But when I was 6 weeks pregnant I was able to fully envision what my life would be like with a child and I hated it. People told me I’d go into a deep depression if I had an abortion and that children bring so much joy and love and that it would all work out and they’d be by my side the whole time… well turns out keeping the baby has put me in a deep depression and I don’t feel much joy or love. 

His dad didn’t want me to keep him. He and I don’t speak. There are days when I imagine dropping my baby off at his dad’s doorstep and saying I’m sorry I can’t do this anymore. But I’m simultaneously extremely protective over my child and would hate myself for doing that. It’s a weird balance. 

Maybe it will get better. He’s only one month old. But in the month I’ve realized more and more everyday how much I regret my choice. I have no freedom. No ability to make my own choices anymore. No time to even shower or eat or sleep without a baby needing me every five minutes. He’s so cute and sweet and in the grand scheme of things he’s easier than most babies thank god.

I just don't want to do this anymore, tried so hard to not give my kid a broken home, at the expense of my own misery for far too long. Wish it were that easy, though. He works construction and his jobs always end where he's in between work until a new project gets picked up. The apartment we live in is in his name, and I just don't want to live with him at all. I work a stable full-time job, was thinking I'd just hack it out in a shelter, even, until I can get back on my feet, in the meantime, I'd pay him child support every two weeks to cover his rent. Anything further my kid needed, I'd pay for whilst he found employment again. Once I find an apartment, we would split 50/50 custody.

We managed to script and save and put the down together to buy a nice 2 1/2 story home in the Midwest.  Really nice place

about 5 years in my oldest son got married and had 4 kids with new wife.  Pretty decent woman, lazy but good.  After their landlord decided to not renew their lease.  After seeing the condition of the apartment, filthy!  So they had about 2 months before they were to move.  They started the search and couldn't come up with anything but a trailer part several towns over from where they were living and it was a terrible environment, not to mention the kids would have to go to a terrible school.

So as parents we bought another home and let them move in our other home.  We were wanting to downsize as this place was quite large and it was the 2 of us in big place.  They had 4 kids and that was a perfect fit.  Our expectation with much discussion was for them to get their credit in line and buy the home for themselves.

Oh yeah you know where this is going.  So that was 5 years ago and they are the most disgusting people I have ever seen.

We did not raise my son this way and we are regretting this decision hard.  We have had multiple discussions on the cleanliness of the house and the upkeep, but it's met with a ""I'll take care of it"".  Every time we go there we have to clean and fix tons of things that were not broke, or even damaged prior to us living there. 

When they go on vacation, we spent almost 3 whole days cleaning and working on the house to make it look really clean and tidy, doing laundry, washing dishes for days in the sink, you name it it needing cleaning.  We have literately cried because we worked our self silly to buy this house and to see it getting mistreated is mind bending to either of us. 

We did this for the Grand-kids sake of not having to live in a dangerous and horrible environment and school.  

Arguments have happened so many times about this topic and others.  Him and his wife do the absolute minimum to appease my wife and I to ""Stay off their backs"".  Were not sure anymore what to do about this.  The house has a loan for 90k but values have gone way up, so now its sitting around 150-160k.

31 January 2025,Did you manage to change your life around despite having children young? I.e career wise or become financially secure. How did you do it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1iebly4/did_you_manage_to_change_your_life_around_despite/,"I was 22/23 when I had my first daughter, and then a year later I had my youngest daughter. By the time I was 25 I had 2 children under 2 a year apart. I have never developed a career or attended university. I always worked dead end jobs before having my children. 

When my daughters were 18 months and 2.5 years old I separated from their father and ended up becoming a single stay at home mother. In the UK we are fortunate to have government assistance to help until our children reach school age. Once your children are school age you’re required to work part time. 

I recently began my own cleaning business in which a year I have developed around 10 clients. I enjoy what I do and the flexibility it gives around being a single parent and all the childcare responsibility. 
Ever since going back to work I realised I want to develop a career and maybe go back to studying. The problem is I have no “village” and their dad is the “weekend parent.” 

I regret becoming a parent due to having to be the default parent. I feel stretched as it is but I dread the future once my children reach teenage years and adulthood as I won’t have developed a stable career for myself. The idea of being financially secure feels along way off. I wish I knew how to turn my life around especially when you feel restricted!

31 January 2025,I’m so tired of this,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ie122k/im_so_tired_of_this/,"I’ll just come out and say it. I hate having a child with autism. I hate my life. He has moderate autism so it could be worse but god it’s definitely not easy. He hates like 90 percent of food, so whatever I cook for dinner he doesn’t want to eat. If something is slightly off about his food he will refuse to eat it. He can’t read I will sit with him and try to teach him but he just can’t comprehend it. He’s so far behind for his age academically I don’t see him catching up no matter how much help he receives. I can hardly understand him when he’s talking even with speech therapy it’s hard to understand him. He’s the reason for 90% of the fights my husband and I have. He’s not interested in school at all. He just refuses to want to learn or participate in school. He’s in smaller class settings and he’s still not catching up. 

He’s actually gotten better over the years though. When he first started school he would be violent to other students, throw things like laptops and hit his teacher. When he was a toddler we couldn’t even bring him in public without him screaming and kicking and hitting us. Family would refuse to keep him for us because of how out of control he was. Now he will just refuse to go with us anywhere and we have to force him out of the house. I don’t really think he will be able to live independently as an adult. He just doesn’t seem to have a lot of common sense I’m noticing. I know I sound horrible and that I’m a bad mom I do love him but this isn’t the life i imagined for myself.

My kids were removed by DHS after I took something I shouldn’t have and got carried away while hanging out with friends with my daughter present. That moment set everything into motion. For the past 4 years, I’ve had the chance to get them back. Even the judge told me she considers me a fit mother—all I need to do is complete the drug and alcohol screenings. But every time I tried, they’d add more requirements, and it felt like I was constantly being tested. Eventually, I gave up.

It’s not that I don’t care—I do. But I’ve been mentally and emotionally drained by this process. I have Major Depressive Disorder and BPD, and the constant pressure, guilt, and stress have taken a toll on me. I’ve been avoiding the screenings because I’m scared of what it means if they return. I don’t feel like I’m in the right place to be the mother they deserve. I want to be there for them, but I don’t know if that’s how I genuinely feel or if it’s just how I’m coping right now. I’m afraid of making a decision I’ll regret later and that my daughters will resent me for not fighting harder.

Since having them, I’ve lost so much of myself. My friendships have changed because I’ve pulled away. I’m not the same person I was before. I’ve lost interest in things I used to love, and I struggle to form new connections. I can’t get into a relationship anymore. Every guy I meet leaves or treats me differently once they find out I have two kids, even though I haven’t been with their dad for years. Social media makes it worse—the way people talk down on “babymamas” as if we’re failures makes me feel like I’m already judged before people even know me.

To add to that, I don’t have a good relationship with their dad’s family. Instead of offering support, they’ve only made things harder and made me feel more isolated. I’ve thought about letting go and accepting that I can’t do this, but that fear of future regret and my daughters resenting me haunts me. I’m stuck between wanting to fight for them and being too drained to keep going.

How do you even begin to heal from this? Is it possible to come back from feeling so lost and broken, or am I just prolonging the inevitable?",Likely mother: 5 > 0
30 January 2025,Divorce saved me,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1idhy1c/divorce_saved_me/,"So from the moment my first kid was born, the horror dawned on me that, while I love kids and have worked with them all my life, this was not going to be that. I never felt the whole madly in love thing when I met my newborn—I was too busy trying not to shake entirely off the operating table after an emergency c section. PPD for sure, not a lot of supports nearby, and my daughter was and is a lunatic. She’s been throwing multiple tantrums a day since she 1 and she is now 6. Add in her 3.5 year old brother with adhd and sensory issues and it makes for some loud, chaotic, stressful house. And I’m an introverted HSP. 

Well, my husband and I got a divorce. And now I have half of my old ass self back. My state is mandatory 50/50 custody unless you can prove abuse or something. Bitches be trying the whole “oh, I could never live without seeing my kids every day!” Guess what! I can. I love my children. I am better able to play with them and be happier with them now I’m no longer drowning forever. When theyrr with their dad, I read/sit on the beach/eat takeout and watch tv/hang out with girlfriends. 

We have been nesting (kids stay in house, parent rotate in and out separately) for 8 months and it works great for our family and for the kids, who never leave their home for another. 

Anyway. Just saying, divorce feels like a vacation to me and I have zero regrets. We’ve got a cordial relationship and still bitch over who cleans what, but I’m used to that. Damn good trade off.",Likely mother: 3 > 0
30 January 2025,Hit a Breaking Point,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1id8i9g/hit_a_breaking_point/,"I'm a 38 year old father of two toddlers (2 year old girl and 3.5 year old boy). Both my wife and I work, so our son is in preschool 3 days out of the week and I stay home Wednesdays just to take care of him while my wife goes to work and my in laws take care of our daughter for the day. You would think that I would love having a day off in the middle of the week, but I absolutely hate it because I have no freedom. My entire day revolves around trying to take care of my son or finding ways to keep him stimulated without resorting to having him watch TV. I take him to get breakfast, go grocery shopping, visit my mom or my in-laws just to pass time, and I really like Jungle Java just so that I can catch my breathe while he's doing his own thing (would love to take him to the park but it's winter).

This particular Wendesday was extremely challenging. For one my son has pink eye following a week of being treated for Influenza A. He did not take a nap after putting him down at his usual time. This was disappointing because that's 2-3 hrs that I didn't get to have to kick back or do things around the house. Then my 18 year old diabetic and hyperthyroid cat threw up 6 times while I was trying to prepare dinner (seafood chowder). I had my son watching TV during this time just so I knew he was nearby. Finally when I finished dinner I turned the TV off and had him sit down. He refused to eat the chowder or yesterdays leftover chicken casserole and only wanted junk food. Finally I snapped and yelled at him.

I know kids this age are difficult and can't help the way they are, but I let the situation get the best of me. My son looked at me with the saddest face and started crying. I was so mad at myself for yelling at him that I went upstairs and cried quietly in the bedroom just to collect myself. My son deserves better than this and it doesn't help that my wife doesn't appreciate anything I do (at least that's how I feel about the situation). 

I apologized to my son and gave him a kiss. He finally came around to eating the chowder but I had to give him a couple rolls of Hawaiian bread to encourage him. I love my wife and children, but I hate being a husband and father. I'm glad I work 4-5 days a week because that's the only time I feel like I have peace.

My goal is to make enough money in the next few years where my wife works part time and we don't need her health insurance. That's the only expense I don't pay myself, but everything else comes out of my salary. I would rather work Wednesdays than stay home with any of my kids all day. I hate saying that but it's the truth.

either learn what I can offer without giving a constant attitude as if Im taking up their time 

or 

teach them nothing. not how to cook a meal. take care of finances. clean up properly. and at 18, boot them straight out of the house with nothing but the clothes on their back.

From the day my partner announced she was pregnant with the second one my depression and anxiety hit me hard and it's becoming unmanageable. 

I accidently got my partner pregnant with the first one when we dated for 8 months. We weren't close or serious with our relationship but I knew she wanted to have children but I didnt. I begged her to have an abortion but she refused. I couldn't leave her to have my son live without a father or a broken family so I decided to stay but I resented her deeply for it. Fast forward 2 years and I unexpectedly found myself develop love and affection for both my son and my girlfriend and the resentment gradually subsided. 

Last year she wanted to try for a second but I was hesitant about it. However I made the mistake to just agree to it to make her happy. At one point I even realized it was a terrible idea and she got angry at me for wearing a condom before sex. I was so fucking naiive of the impact it would make on our lives and the toll it would take on my mental health. From a young age I knew I never wanted to children let alone being married because I came from an abusive household and I suffered from severe depression and anxiety and substance abuse and I didn't want to pass on my pain and suffering onto anyone. I also enjoyed being alone because I was accustomed to it for most my life and the feeling of having others depend on me burdens me with anxiety because I can barely trust relying on myself. 

My children don't deserve this but I am so fucking exhausted mentally physically and financially with this relationship. I feel so guilty for bringing them into this world only for them to experience the trauma and pain of being the children of a financially and mentally unstable loser of a father. The resentment I felt towards my partner has reemerged and it's now even worse than before.

28 January 2025,The guilt of not wanting a second,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ibqvlr/the_guilt_of_not_wanting_a_second/,"I will try keep this short although I want to include alllll the background info. I never wanted kids but was more impartial than anything. Had a shitty partner for many years that made the decision a no brainer, then i met my goofy loving husband who really wanted a family. We got pregnant after 2 years of trying. I was not excited but deep down knew I’d love my kid. I hated being pregnant and my husband said it was really hard for him to feel joy about my pregnancy because I was so negative. 

The moment my son came out I felt a joy that is indescribable and a love so full and deep it is unlike anything else I’ve ever felt. And on the hospital bed I remember feeling “my family is complete”  

I took to motherhood quite well, I got ppd/ppa but it was mostly due to lack of maternal care/leave options in my country that made me angry. 

I quit pumping at 10 months and I focused on myself. I started having fun and doing things for myself. After my son turned 2, we started getting sitters more and living life outside of parenthood. Plus, We do so much as a family and I love our little trio. I have no interest in messing with what I have. 

I think for someone who didn’t want kids, having one kid is a compromise. So many of the things that made me not want kids exist (lack of sleep, expenses, time), BUT they aren’t that bad. My son is my favorite person. He’s cool and likes us and likes doing things. No allergies or big health problems, likes traveling. He’s fun. He’s still little but he’s just a great person and has enhanced my life. 

Why would I risk ruining my life with a second child? Not even mentioning money and house/car logistics (which are huge considerations tbh), I just don’t want to gamble. I do feel a tinge of sadness over it. I think having a sibling is an experience that helps you out in life, but I know it’s not perfect. I love my brother but I wonder how my life might have been without him. 
 
All of this to say. My husband wants another so badly. We tried. I got off birth control for almost 2 years. I decided I was done trying and honestly we fought over it the entire time I wasn’t on birth control. Some months I avoided sex during ovulation. And I don’t regret my decision… but I think there’s resentment in my marriage. My son asks for a baby. Everyone asks when we’re having another. I even think I want another in weird moments. But deep down, I think I’ve made the right choice. And I’m only 35. I know that should I change my mind, we could give it another shot? But I feel so much hope for my future in a family of 3 and only feel despair if I think of a future family of 4 

(The caveat is the way I feel about a second baby is basically exactly how I felt about my son before he got here. And I don’t regret having him. Motherhood is hard af but I’m glad I did it… mostly. Like 90/10)",Likely mother: 4 > 0

And she knows damn well how much i envy her

Me and my husband have 3 kids (8M, 6F and 1M) (29M). We live in a small country in Europe, first off i want to say my first pregnancy completely fucking wrecked my body i used to be fucking beautiful but i already started looking 30 at 20 and was oblivious to it. My husband is from a traditional family and has traditional family views i always thought (or maybe i pretended or was conditioned into it i dont even know) i have the same views as him. Also its worth mentioning im SAHM. We live on 2300 euros a month which can give you a extremely comfortable life if youre childless or have 1 kid. We never took any vacations abroad which i always wanted to do. Our honeymoon was in my husbands fucking parents house on the coast and it was hell to be honest. My in laws dont respect me at all and Im just starting to realize it. I dont know why but i thought i liked it at the time and used to glamourize my life. I thought about divorcing him but i have no experience and the job market in our country is the worst. 

Now about my cousin(22F) who i literally stalk at this point. When we were younger i always looked down on her and has a borderline superiority complex over her because she dreamed big and had extremely specific things in mind for herself. For an example her dad (my uncle) took her to Hong Kong and other big cities abroad every year for his bussines trips and she always used to say one day shell be a flight attendant and earn money to buy an apartment in HongKong. I vividly remember when she said that on a family function when she was 16 and i was 20 (and got married to my husband). I laughed into her face then.

Fast forward to now she achieved everything she wanted and more. And shes absoloutely stunning and full of life, her eyes are literally full of happiness. She did become a flight attendant (even tho she has a bussines degree too), moved to Hong Kong before the pandemic for uni, met her fucking loaded fiance whos literally her dream guy. Her and her fiance have been together for 2 years for those 2 years she has been showered with gifts, goes to expensive restaurants WHENEVER SHE FUCKING WANTS, goes on dates at least 2 times a week... Needless to say me and my husband dont go on dates at all. Our last ""date"" was for our anniversary and i had to cook the food while my youngest daughter was crying and screaming

She came to our country this summer and we all went to her parents house and my god you could fucking tell she was happy to see me in the place i am right now. I get it i was unnecessarly rude to her when we were younger and tried to discourage her but was it seriously bad enough for me to get this fate? Worst thing was when my husband told her ""Just wait till you have kids you wont be so glamorous and you'll sag up like *my name*"" TO WHICH SHE SAID HER AND HER FIANCE DONT PLAN TO GET PREGNANT AND THEYLL GET A SURROGATE. SHE SAID IT SO PROUDLY IT WAS LIKE A SLAP TO MY FACE.

I FELT LIKE FUCKING SCREAMING. 

My husband always had something rude to say when anyone mentioned her like calling her a ""hedonist"" or spoiled and to be honest i would always nod my head when he insulted her.

Im a fucking idiot. I shouldnt have judged her and i shouldnt have ever laughed at her during that fucking dinner 6 years ago. I made very close minded comments that were borderline racist about her fiance too when she announced him as her bf to us too. Ive made mistakes but was i that fucking horrible to deserve this?

I love my children, but if i could all do it again with knowledge i have now i would never. Mostly because of the pregnancies. My first pregnancy was incredibly difficoult and post partum depression (which my husband doesnt believe in) was even worse. My husband wanted more children so he convinced me it will work and ill bounce back... Im laughing while holding back tears as i type this. I mostly miss the social life i had and my old body i had, it would be good if my husband sometimes looked after the kids too but i dont even mind taking care of them so much because i truly love them.

I dont think i would be regretful only if i havent dluded myslef into this tradition SAHM fantasy that doesnt exist.

What the fuck do i even do at this point i dont know how ill manage this for the next 20 something years. Usually most people here (that i assume live in america or aestern countries) are done after 18 years and their kids are off to uni but here its normal for the kids to live with their parents until theyre 30. Even if mine choose to leave after theyre done with uni thats still 20 more years of these repetitive depressed days... Why the fuck did i do this",Likely mother: 14 > 3
27 January 2025,"My kids are perfect, yet I still resent them",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ib5fqa/my_kids_are_perfect_yet_i_still_resent_them/,"My kids are amazing. My 10-year-old son makes me eggs for breakfast and my 12-year-old daughter makes lunch and cleans. She can make almost anything I ask her to. They are such good children. They never, well hardly ever, complain. They just want to spend time being close to me, even when all I want to do is scroll online all day. They will just sit quietly next to me with their own projects just to be close to me. Sometimes my daughter will ask to watch with me and it annoys me because I just want to be alone. 
I'm divorced and we have split custody so I don't have them all the time. These kids are extremely well behaved, great students, no emotional or social or psychological issues. When they are with me, they don't want to do extracurricular activities, they just want to hang out with me.
Yet, I resent them. I hate them. Well, I don't hate them but I feel like they are holding me back in life. I feel like my life was ruined because I had them. I feel like I've been so burnt out by taking care of them since I got divorced, that I lost myself. I couldn't do both. I couldn't take care of myself and take care of them at the same time. Now I'm turning 40 and I haven't been able to do anything with my life. I have never been able to hold down a stable job since I got divorced because I couldn't juggle their schedule and a demanding a career, so I took simple dead-end jobs with flexibility so I could be there for my kids. Because of this, I'm always broke and it makes me resent them even more. I do have a clinical diagnosis of depression.
 It's not their fault. It's my fault for not being able to be strong enough to juggle my life in the right way. I just don't feel like I can be a mom and have a full-time career at the same time. I don't think I can handle it mentally. The one time that my work schedule conflicted with my son's play and he was so disappointed that I wasn't there, killed me. I feel so bad for the way that I feel. I feel so guilty. They don't deserve it. I do miss them when they aren't here, but when they are here I just get very overwhelmed and I shut down. I know that they need me, and I try to give them everything that they want, but it's hard for me. My son always asks me to play with him and I dread playing with them. I really don't enjoy it. When we're playing games together I just wants to die of boredom and I can't wait until it's over. I just tell him that I'm not feeling well which isn't a lie. I know that I suffer from anhedonia. I am in therapy for those who are wondering. 
I just resent them. I resent that I had them. People tell me that having kids is the greatest joy but I don't feel joy. I never really wanted kids, but I had them because I felt like that's what I had to do at the time. 
I just feel like they are a burden. When they are here, my house gets messy and I hate it. When they are here, I have to feed them and my grocery bill goes up exponentially and I hate it ( we agreed on no child support so I don't get financial help). Because of them I can't move to a warmer climate, and I live in a place that I absolutely hate just because I have to be close to them. I've thought of abandoning them many many times, but I just can't bring myself to do it because it would devastate them and I don't want to emotionally scar them. They have no idea how I feel and they feel happy and loved. I tell them I love them all the time, and shower them with compliments and praise. 
I just don't feel like I have a life. I feel like I'm just existing. I haven't been able to make my life better since I left my unfulfilling marriage and the whole point of leaving him was to make my life better. My life didn't become better. It became harder and worse. I feel like I really fucked up. Now I'm stuck with these kids and I can't get out of this hole that I dug myself into because I feel like they are like a ball and chain holding me down. I don't understand how people like motherhood because I don't like it. I don't like being a mother.",Likely mother: 1 > 0

He was making you call me a bitch?"" and she replied ""yes but he isn't making me anymore."" So the mystery unravels.

He did something that I told him not to do (can’t remember what anymore), and I put him in his room for timeout with the door locked (we used to have to do this before the house was entirely childproofed as he would get up in the middle of the night and try to get into stuff). I was so tired, I sat on the couch for just a minute and closed my eyes for just a second… but then I woke up. And realized I had fallen asleep for god knows how long. I ran to his room, and he was inconsolable. He had taken off all of his clothes, peed all over his room, and thrown everything around. I will literally never forgive myself for this.

I am the product of a an abusive household, while I'll spare the details the abuse was quit extensive and has always followed me around all my life. Because of it im prone to low moods, don't really know how to regulate my stress levels or environment and I have bad anxiety. 

One thing that I find hard parenting is when my son is just being a normal toddler. I'm a sahm mother and also self employed but I'll soon be going back to work full time in a week. 

I've been at home with him for 4 years it's really torn my mental health to shreds from the constant noise and overstimulation. To the point I have off days where I feel really irritable,  annoyed at the slightest sound or normal head toddler behavior. My patience is thin and so is my tolerance. 

I'm a single parent with limited support family wise and his dad only has him two nights a week. Childcare and parenting plus hospital appointments and all of the parenting mainly falls on me because he's fun dad. No family support so please don't suggest taking time our during the week or asking for a break, my breaks are when he's with his dad but during the week their are none. 

So how do you handle poor mental health and the overwhelming side of parenting ? The constant noise, the demands when your feeling low and so forth ?

I don’t have the family support needed for this and very few friends who all have jobs themselves and work weekends too. I found a sitter for this day thankfully but she isn’t able to start till next week. 

My boss is unpredictable. Some days he’s cool others he is not. I never know what to expect which makes the anxiety and stress worse. I am currently laying in bed about an hour late to work with the intention of waiting for him to call and ask where I am so I can use the excuse “Omg I overslept” this makes me feel guilt because I don’t want to leave anyone hanging but the unpredictability of my bosses reaction and words get me to this point. I love my job and everyone I work even my boss just sometimes his behavior sucks.

We're able to have a socal life and me and my husband have an amazing relationship together, we have a great income meaning we have money to give our daughter a good life aswel as ourselves. My daughter has never wanted a siblings and made it very clear that she enjoys being an only. She has friends come round all the time and when they're not we do things together as a little family of 3.

But lately my friends keep telling me she needs a siblings because ""what's she going to do when she's older"" they're almost pressuring me and making me feel guilty. I've been called selfish to name a few. I've seen their lives and how stressed they're with more than 1 and it's not the life I want for myself, my husband or my daughter....it looks like choas yet they're adamant I need to go down that path in life.

23 January 2025,"Major regret and resentment, especially towards my child’s father",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i7yu36/major_regret_and_resentment_especially_towards_my/,"For context, I lived in Asia for 2 years and before leaving back to my hometown I found out I was about 4 months along but still had the chance to terminate the pregnancy. I knew in my heart that it would be the best decision because soo many factors were at play which wouldn’t be beneficial for my child e.g I would be away from her father for however long until he could join us, I wouldn’t be able to financially provide until I got through postpartum and got a job(so I’d solely rely on the father) and that I was a fence sitter when it came to having kids. However even with all these factors I was managed to be convinced by my mother, best friends and the father to carry on with the pregnancy. I felt like I was supported immensely by all of them and decided to carry on with having the child. 

Fast forward to present day and my baby is now 3 months old. She is generally a good baby but I had a traumatic birth. I feel completely bamboozled by the decision to have the kid. Don’t get me wrong, everyone in my life has been great except for the father of my child. I feel deep resentment towards him for basically making me a single mother. His only job was to communicate effectively (since we’re 8 hours and a whole continent apart) and to provide financially until we could be together and I got a job. He’s been soo inconsistent with both and we’ve had multiple arguments about it. He barely acknowledges how much of a toll this has had on my postpartum journey. I’m exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally most days and I can’t see a way out of this as I have to rely on him - especially financially. That’s what adds to my stress and worries! I told him multiple times that I didn’t think it was a good idea to bring a baby into our situation but he would always reassure me that he’s got me and the baby. Yet, I haven’t been able to relax since the last 2 months of my pregnancy. It’s gotten to the point where I barely answer his texts and I told him that if I didn’t respond it just meant that I didn’t want to talk those days. My mother and friends say that I’m pushing him away and to be more considerate and give him time to improve but to hell with that. My whole life has changed which I knew would be a possibility but I had the comfort of trusting that my partner would be there for me. The complete opposite is what I’ve gotten and it’s been a huge pill to try and swallow. When I put my baby to sleep, I’m always hoping she never wakes up again so I can be freed from this life that I soo deeply hate. I love her, she’s adorable and almost no trouble but I also should’ve just been her aunt or godmother. I don’t feel an overwhelming amount of joy being a mother. It’s exhausting and thankless. I regret being naive enough to have been convinced to have a baby and partake in motherhood. It’s a scam! The sheer amount of work and responsibility solidified my initial desire to not continue with the pregnancy. I loved my life prior and would’ve been happier if I had a dog instead.

I have my daughter most of the time. I have been her primary care giver since conception. Her dad has been in and out the entire time. He lived in the same state as us for about 2 years, he didn't show up to most of his visits and found something warm (a single mom with a deadbeat dad, the irony) to lay next soon the first chance he got instead of spending time with his biological kid. A few years ago, we went to court. The next year we went back because he decided to move out of state again. The court awarded me everything. He got visitation. I currently have $15k in back child support unpaid.

The last few months have been terrible. Baby has been lashing out at me and telling me how horrible I am for disciplining her when she acts out, making her do homework, and not being able to see her dad. I have tried for the last few months to stay calm and explain things to her in an age appropriate way. But the last few days have been worse. Her dad has been telling her she doesn't have to do what I tell her. When I confronted him, he said he wanted to take me back to court. We got in a screaming match and, since I was on the phone w/ headphones, Baby only hears me screaming and yells at me to stop yelling at her dad. (Note: his excuse for not visiting us - which I have always offered - is because he doesn't want me to get mad at him.) The next day he called her and, what I can only assume, told her his version of events and that he was going to take her away and get full custody.

Today Baby was having a meltdown over some homework and because I disciplined her for breaking house rules. She tells me her dad is going to go to court and take her away and he's always nice and she would listen to him and she doesn't need discipline. The homework didn't get done and I just sent her to bed. I swear, there are times like these when I feel like is this even all worth it?

We have been together for the last 9 years, married for 7 and dated in high school. We’ve known each other since we were 5 & 6 years old. He moved out and into his mom’s house last month and is still pretty active with the kids (5 & 7 years old). Our oldest has autism and yall it is taking such a toll on me. It always has as I’ve always been a single married mom. But now it’s to a point where I literally can’t get a full time job right now. I just started a wfh job last week and I know it’s not going to last because I can’t have any background noise. It took me months to find this fucking job and it’s bottom of the barrel but I needed something! Safe to say, if I stay I will get fired because he cannot sit still and be quiet long. Not only that, he got kicked out of the afterschool program I had him and his sister in for his behavior. So I have to pick him up during my shift. I took this job in hopes that after training they can work with me around the time I need to pick him up. I moved back to my hometown to have help from my family and I have absolutely no one’s help outside of my dad and his wife, who also work full time. My biggest regret in my life is reconnecting with this man. He has made my life a living a hell and I now suffer from depression, anxiety, and struggle terribly with my mental health from his manipulative and abusive ways. When I reconnected with him I was doing great for myself and living in another state in city. I literally moved back because HE wanted to be closer to family. And it feels like I have no way out. He works a swing shift, so he can help but not in ways that’ll help me. I love my children but I genuinely wish I did not have them with him. Now I feel like shit for just wanting to leave them with him and go off to live my life. He won’t know the first thing about taking care of them the way they need because he was an absent minded dummy when he lived here. I feel like I’m fucking suffering and no matter how much I try to take accountability for my choices, nothing seems to get better. I want to pack them up and move elsewhere but even that seems to be a struggle. I was a sahm for most of our marriage because i had to work around my children and so I have nothing saved, literally $3.00 to my name. I’m so over living like this, but I can’t leave them here on this earth alone. I look into their eyes everyday and it’s the only thing that keeps me here. I just wish I knew what I was getting myself into. This shit sucks so bad, I’m thinking about joining the damn military just to catch a break and let him figure out this parenting shit until I’m done training. Idk, I’m just desperate and can’t seem to figure this shit out. I genuinely thought I could get this job to work with him and it’s my first time trying it out, but it’s just not going to be possible. I just figured it wouldn’t hurt to try because there’s no amount of money that would ever make me stay with my husband.",Unclear: 3 / 3
21 January 2025,Birthday ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i6o9ns/birthday/,"I was wrapping up presents for my son's third birthday which is in two day's time and suddenly felt really depressed.

Last Monday, I thought I'd treat myself to sushi that not only it didn't give me a break, but it actually gave me histamine food poisoning. Two days later, my son suddenly developed a fever and he couldn't return to daycare until today while his older brother had a mild version of the illness. 

I feel so exhausted from looking after two sick kids while being sick myself.

Today I got wrapping paper and birthday cake. I was preparing while I might be coming down on the illness the kids had.
I was like why are birthdays special? It's just another day. I had a precipitous labour when I had my fist son, so was induced to have my second son who didn't come out for two days anyway. It's just a random day that he was born. 

I don't feel the happy celebration cheer inside of me at all but I have to fake it.

There's this tradition where I live where preschool kids have a birthday party at school with his classmates, so I had to get another cake and some snacks for the school party.

Faking it feels heavy, especially when we just had to go through a very exhausting week.

Having to fake it makes me think why can't I just be happy for his birthday, but the exhaustion numbed all my positive feelings.

My first son will be 5 in March. My second son will be 3 in two days.

I still don't see any light yet.

For 3-4 months I was deeply regretful wanted to run away and leave him with my mom and husband. i wrote posts here about how regretful I was and how wonderful my life was before having him. fast forward 4-7 months my regret completely disappeared replaced with crazy love and adoration. it's even hard for me to let my mom babysit him because i want to be around him 24/7. however, the only times small inklings of regret come back is when he is not eating well (which is a major pain point for me since he was born on a lower percentile). so i am curious is anyone else here a FORMER regretful parent or what i would call a TARGETED regretful parent where your regret only comes back in times of extreme stress. my LO barely sleeps at night but even that does not give me pause- only when he doesn't eat well i worry so much i regret being unable to control this absolute and unconditional love. any one here former regretful parent or targeted regretful parent?",Likely mother: 2 > 0

You think maybe just one and done and that will be a great adventure. No. I have an 8 month old and I have been in a world of regret.

Things I have lost since getting pregnant:

\- My job (because I was vomiting my soul out for 5 months in pregnancy and they had to fill my position, it was a contract)

\- My fiancé (he got so sick of being the only one working, plus being homeless, having to move in with my family and alcoholic father was a nightmare, plus taking care of me day and night to the point of having to physically take me to the bathroom because I could not walk)

\- My health (extreme low iron, pelvic girdle pain, could not walk, extreme hypothyroidism)

\- My sanity (laying in bed day after day, vomiting my guts out, unsure what time it is and if I have eaten)

\- My housing (no job = no rent money, took 4 months to get on to Social Assistance)

\- The ability to do virtually anything I enjoy ever (I cannot read, I try to workout but no, my thyroid shuts down, I try to do a walk and there is always some disaster plus it's minus 28 degrees out right now)

\- My social life (I have zero friends left at all, literally zero because I had to move across the country from Vancouver to New Brunswick and plus being so sick I didn't keep in touch with anyone and their lives moved on, plus I don't do other social media)

They say, ohhh, it's all worth it......

Things I have gained:

\- Poverty (I make $1,300 a month and have to live off the government until she is old enough to get into daycare... the average rent in my city is $1,100, so I will just leave that there and you all know how expensive groceries are, gas, baby items, do not even get me started)

\- Constant screaming and whining (nothing is wrong with her, she is loved and cared for, she has a nurse come monthly and goes to the doctor bi-monthly, she eats well, has a lot of toys and clothes despite the financial chaos)

\- Scratches on my face (bleeding ones too), red pinch marks on my arms, chunks of hair that have been pulled out, lots of kicking (WHY)

\- Insanity (everything is a fight, the bath, the car seat, a nap, sleeping at night, breastfeeding, getting a diaper on, getting a diaper off, putting on a sleeper, putting on clothes, this child is STRONG and like a fighting monkey and does. not. tire. out)

\- Constant sleep deprivation (2-3 wake ups a night, breastfeeding, plus I have not slept in past 5am in 8 months, that is on top of the almost year-long pregnancy pain and insomnia)

\- Mental Illness (I do not know what is wrong with me, but I find it impossible to have energy to make friends. I fly off the handle almost every bath time because there is water and pee and lotion EVERY WHERE. I have a university degree and was a social worker for 10 years and usually handle stress SO well) I go to 5, 1-hour long programs a week Monday to Friday, like songs at the library and bouldering for babies at the gym, and the weekends to just relax. I find the other Moms here are a bit stuck up and are not interested in befriending a single Mom)

I lost everything. I lost myself. I am full of regret.

20 January 2025,A moment,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i623ep/a_moment/,"I had typed up a post before leaving for vacation. (Today is our last day here) but I got frustrated because it was taking forever and I was having issues going back to the point I left off at.

While on vacation I was relieved for a moment. Me and my son (5yr old, single mom) we’re having fun. I forget the feelings of regret.

I was explaining to my sister why I think my son can be so difficult sometimes. He has tantrums often. Can be spiteful. For example he will tell me he doesn’t like certain foods just to get out of eating it. Everything  is what he wants and if it’s not the tantrum begins. He even insults me. 

His dad was addicted to drugs. I eventually left. But he was beating me down so much. I wasn’t the same responsive fun loving mother for some time. I was depressed and collapsed. I had to go into a homeless shelter to leave. I have no parents left they’ve passed. My sister is at the bottom of the country and I’m at the top. So I don’t have much help and his dads family are difficult people who have (somewhat thankfully) abandoned my son. I’m struggling.

Anyways she mentions “that’s why me and my girlfriend did plant’s first, then cats, next is kids” that’s fucking great for you guys. He’s already here. It’s too late for me. It was so unhelpful. We were talking about me here not you and your life choices. Had a known sooner about the addiction I would have had an abortion. I never wanted to be a single mom in housing on assistance. But I’m trying my best. I believe my son has oppositional defiant disorder due to my deep depression and now that I’m ready to be a present parent his behaviors make me not want to be a mother anymore. I love him I do but he is so fucking difficult which makes me feel like shit because kids are a reflection of us. I truly want to be a good mom but just feel I can’t make it happen. I wasn’t ready and clearly dad wasn’t either. Then he had to go and die on top of it only adding to the guilt and regrets. I’m so angry with him, his family and of course myself. I want to be a loving patient mother but I’m not supported, broke and stressed. I fear the teenagers years  already. The stress. God the stress.",Likely mother: 4 > 1
20 January 2025,I don’t connect with my kid like others do. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i5w261/i_dont_connect_with_my_kid_like_others_do/,"Let me start by saying my son is kind, vibrant, helpful, generous, hardworking, and enthusiastic. He’s a great kid, and I don’t regret him, but the relationship isn’t that rewarding. 

A few notes about me: 

-I’m an only child and was very close with my single parent mom growing up. Still am. 

-My son is adopted from foster care. We got him at age 12 and he’s 18.5 now still finishing his senior year. He was very difficult but around age 14 turned things around suddenly and has been quite easy since. Emotionally he’s more like 16 and will probably live at home for a few more years. 

-He’s gay. You’d think this would make it easier for us to bond, but it hasn’t. 

-My husband and I are crazy close. Have been together for 19 years. So know my son feels like a third wheel a lot. 

So here’s the problem. I’m grateful we all found each other, because I know my husband and I wanted the parenting experience (and in ways it was honestly nice to have a more brief parenting experience) and my son needed a family. He’s grateful for us and we are grateful for him. 

With that said, he’s on the spectrum, and somewhat detached due to childhood trauma. (He’s done therapy.) He claims he wants closeness with me, but he keeps conversations extremely surface level, much of the time repeating himself. 

“So I’m getting paid on Friday.” 

And then an hour later, “So don’t forget I’m getting paid on Friday.” 

In the beginning of having him I tried to teach him more meaningful ways to make conversation- how you don’t use ask yes or no questions. He never really caught on I think perhaps due to some ambivalence about vulnerability, and I’ve somewhat given up. 

I do think getting him older is part of why we aren’t as close. People can say whatever they want, but in my experience, it’s hard to build connection sometimes with an older child. I love him, but it doesn’t feel like the same love I see some biological parents have with their kids. Not to mention sense of humor is huge to me and our sense of humors don’t match at all. He doesn’t seem to understand too much dryness. 

In conclusion, I just feel some sadness. I see other moms out at like Starbucks with their kids gabbing away, and then for me, most of the time when my son approaches me I just feel like, “oh yay. I can’t wait for him to rattle up a series of mindless facts that he’s already told me five times over the last two days.”

He has me saved in his phone as Mom Queen Of My Life, so you can only imagine the guilt I feel sometimes.

20 January 2025,I hate holidays because of my kid.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i5qc7v/i_hate_holidays_because_of_my_kid/,"Holidays have become depressing for me because I have to be around my kid all day. A day off work for me unfortunately means a day off school for him (3 y-o) which means the holiday actually ends up becoming more work than my actual job. I love him, but hate being a parent. My entire day is now his and it’s depressing. It’s the feeling of forcefully giving up your freedom and you have no say about it.

19 January 2025,Terrified.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i4tlrq/terrified/,"I am a regretful parent. 

Each and every post here I can relate to. 

If it wasn’t for this sub I honestly think I would’ve tanked by now. It has helped me work through my issues and I’ve been able to identify the root cause of my feelings - it’s not my kid, it’s the fkn low life grub I had him to. 

Now it’s been almost 7y since I left. 7yrs. His father keeps on about contact, and I even left kiddo there. It had to stop because kid started doing sexualised behaviours. I am not sure if something happened, I’m not sure if he was exposed to something, but I truly in my heart and mind believe something happened. 

I tried supervising contact, but kids ‘father’ kept smoking heaps of cannabis (which I don’t care if he smokes cannabis, but he does it in the bathroom and kiddo wouldn’t use the bathroom and started peeing outside, then ‘father’ would tell him off, plus I am no longer a cannabis user, but the temptation too great and the risk of losing kid and licence and car and my livelihood is too great, ie traffic laws). 

I tried doing the phone calls and he was just using it to get at me, saying passive aggressive stuff and making kid upset and blaming me for the whole relationship/visitation thing breaking down, making me upset, but making kiddo upset more and it absolutely destroyed me inside. 

I’m hoping like hell he doesn’t pursue formal channels, often the whole court order thing is ruinous to women (and men) trying to leave horrible people. 

I have found myself loving my son more and more everyday, but it’s tainted by this regret and I can’t run, can’t hide and going through it is like crawling through fire and broken glass. 

I regret that I had my son, only because of his horrible, wretched ‘father.’ Even the term sperm donor is too kind.

I’ve done the whole wheel of legal advice etc, and they say just to wait until he does legal action. But I want to avoid that Avenue. I don’t know what to do.",Likely mother: 2 > 0

The bathroom isn't locked anymore bc we're gearing up for potty training.

I love my son. I love my husband. I love them both so much it hurts. But I'm exhausted and every weekend I just want to drink a cup of coffee while it's still hot, while I'm not working.

I hate that my workload has been so crazy in the last few months I'm now averaging 10-11 hour days, because then I feel guilty for seldom seeing my kid during the week but as soon as the weekend hits I just want to get the hell away from him and my husband.

 I hate the guilt and shame I feel. I hate that I feel guilty for just wanting to relax on my weekend, I hate that when I try to take a break I feel awful, I hate that when I don't take breaks I get snippy, I hate that we can't afford daycare and we can't afford my husband being home full-time, I hate so many things in my life right now. 

I hate that I've become a workaholic because I would rather be working and interacting with adults and solving problems than being climbed over and needed by my son who just wants to spend time with me, I hate that my thoughts lately are ""things would be easier if he just didn't exist.""

I hate everything. I hate that I like and need my job just enough to not quit. I hate that I love my son and husband enough to not leave.

I hate that I'm not shitty enough of a manager to quit when my team needs me. I hate that I'm not shitty enough to just leave my family. I hate that I'm decent enough to put my needs on the back burner. I hate that I'm good enough to make sacrifices. I hate it.

Because I just want to be selfish. I just want to pick up and drive away. I wish I didn't marry my husband, because he deserves a wife that doesn't want these things. I wish we didn't have our kid because he deserves a mom who doesn't hide out in pantries when she just doesn't feel like building train tracks just for them to be destroyed.

And I guess I should also rephrase the ""hate"" part, I dont hate her I just hate her attitude and the disrespect. I hate being treated like shit when I would literally die for her. 

BUT Ive raised my daughter all by myself. Ive done the best I could. No I'm not perfect and never claimed to be but I really loved my daughter from the moment I decided to keep her. And I dont care judge me for this but I was 19 when I got pregnant and I knew that the guy I was with was NOT going to be around or a good father so I questioned keeping her, but my mom convinced me that she would help me and so I did and I honestly loved her and talked to her from the moment she was in my belly. 

Now my mom ended up passing away when she was about 3, her father is really just a sperm donor (as I expected) absent and does not pay any child support - even though its ordered. 

I thought that I was a loving parent. I was also young, had her 3 months shy of my 21st birthday. But I literally chose her over everything, even didn't dating or barely go out. I went to college and tried to get myself into a career that was a m-f 9-5 so that I could be there for her with school. I loved her so much and she loved me. 

Well my daughter is now almost 17 and for the last almost 2 years I just find myself saying in my head ""I hate her""""I hate being a mom"" and then i start feeling down because a good parent wouldn't/shouldn't feel that way about their child right? So Im just the shit scum of the earth. But she is so mean and tells me all the time how Ive never really been a parent and ""dont start trying to be one to me now"" She is going through some mental health issues and as much as I try to help her she refuses, so then I am depressed because I can't do anything to help. 

Around her 16th birthday things REALLY started going downhill. I got so depressed due to her decline in mental health/ability to do well in school but refusal to accept anything that would be helpful or beneficial. So this put me into a deep depressing and I started counseling and depression medication. 
At 37 I was diagnosised with ADHD so Im sure there were LOTS of things I did wrong or out of impulsiveness (which I am learn that is part of the disability of ADHD) Again, not a perfect parent. 

Even through therapy and medication I feel like shes right and I am a just a shitty parent and I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I feel like she would be better off without me at this point. I feel like I failed her from being in a single parent household (where I had to go to work to pay bills/rent instead of be around for her).. because I didnt force her in sports (I tried offering but she was never interested).. because I still expect her to ride the bus when I have a day off and dont want to take her.. 

We are both in therapy. I am currently in 4 group therapy sessions, one individual counseling session as well as see my dr regularly.

My regret is that I feel like I was naive to think my kids would have a similar childhood as me by getting to know the neighborhood friends, playing until the streetlights came on. We've been here for 7 years and that hasn't been the case. Long story short, no one plays outside. I wish I was exaggerating. I thought if the neighbors see my kids playing outside, they'd come out & join them, it hasn't happened. We don't even know the neighborhood kids' names because they get shuttled to & from school. We're the only family that makes the 10 minute walk to the grade school, everyone else is driven. We live in a safe neighborhood, no busy streets. I thought that we'd get to know the other families on our walk to school but we're alone.

Anyways all this to say, my neighborhood hasn't changed in 7 years and I'm doubtful it will ever be like that 90s kid childhood I had. So how do I change my perspective?

14 January 2025,hate my life right now ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i1iz13/hate_my_life_right_now/,"i feel like i’ve made the biggest mistake of my life by becoming a parent. and i hate saying that because it feels so wrong and heartbreaking to feel this way towards an innocent person who didn’t ask to be here. i’m 22 and had her when i was 18. she’s almost 4 and so many people told me things would get better by now but it hasn’t. i miss my old life i miss the freedom of laying around all day without worrying about feeding, bathing, playing, tantrums, potty training and accidents, reading and teaching. i don’t have the energy for any of it anymore and the most i can manage is to turn on the tv for her and get back in bed, occasionally getting up to give her food. i go to therapy and have been on zoloft for about a month now which has helped tremendously with anxiety but the depression is only getting worse and im afraid to be honest because i don’t want her taken from me. i never felt that natural affection for her the way other moms have talked about feeling toward their kids. i never gained that emotional connection toward her. i just feel like a wild animal with the natural instinct to protect and feed her but the ushy gushy lovey dovey stuff never came with that. i can tolerate her sometimes but every interaction we have makes me irritable, uncomfortable and resentful and i hate feeling this way because she doesn’t deserve it at all. sometimes it’s hard to even choke out an “i love you”. i feel like such a shitty person. her dad and i broke up early 2023. he was never really the best person and for the first few months of 2022 he had disappeared on us due to “depression”. our relationship was pretty much on and off and super unhealthy after the first two years but he didn’t become the disgusting human he is until after i left him. we tried to have a friendship in the beginning phase of our breakup but he became emotionally and physically abusive, belittling me, threatening me, calling me disgusting things and throwing everything he knew about me in my face to try and break me down. he physically abused me in front of our daughter and blamed me for it. i hate him with every fiber of my being. he’s inconsistent, he barely helps, doesn’t financially support us at all. i do all of the heavy lifting and he picks her up on fridays and drops her off on sundays and that’s about it. he can’t even be bothered to simply schedule a doctors appointment and take her to it for once. the only peace i found in this whole ordeal was to stop messaging him in hopes that he would change and just allow him to be who he is. now he leaves me alone. i’m so mentally drained from motherhood. i’m tired of being called, tired of being touched, tired of being yelled at and talked at and cried at. i don’t play with her anymore, don’t read to her or do arts and crafts like we used to. i barely interact with her. i just hate myself and my life right now. i’m a terrible mother and she deserves so much more than me. i’m not sure what to do anymore. i feel trapped and i can’t talk to anyone about it because i made this choice. i’ve lost all my
friends because i’ve isolated myself and become a prisoner to motherhood. i don’t have the energy to interact with anyone anyway. i have no one but my boyfriend who is amazing but im afraid pretty soon this will be too much for him too and then i’ll be back to square one and all alone. pls someone help me",Likely mother: 3 > 1
15 January 2025,I think I hate being a mom..sorry for the long post,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i1myn2/i_think_i_hate_being_a_momsorry_for_the_long_post/,"My first child(7) is an absolute nightmare. I have another child(3) who despite all the usual toddler behavior is extremely well behaved. My husband and I are at our wits end, we’re exhausted from the constant fighting with our oldest. They don’t listen they’re extremely disrespectful and always doing things they know are they aren’t supposed to do. They will even try to get our second to join them when being naughty. When they’re together they are absolute chaos. I stay at home with my youngest and I LOVE the alone time I get with them. I dread the moment my oldest comes home from school. I both love and hate leaving the home for my part time job. I love it because I get a break from being around them. I hate it bc I’m leaving my husband to deal with them alone. I have adhd and have awful sensory issues and get overstimulated very easily. Im not always the best mom, in fact im not even close. I know I shouldn’t compare but I see all these other moms who are gentle and their kids listen to them when they talk. I get jealous bc why can’t my kid be respectful and at the very least act like they are listening to me? Mine won’t even acknowledge that they’re hearing us. Why can’t I be a more patient mom? I’m convinced my oldest hates me. And I’m not entirely sure I like them much either. Lately they only want their dad and will scream until they get their way. Which makes it incredibly hard for us to have any time to ourselves at all after bedtime bc they take forever to listen and actually go to sleep. 

They have meltdowns so bad that we sometimes have to remove our youngest while one of us deals with the others meltdowns. I can’t imagine what our neighbors think hearing the screaming that sometimes happens. I’m so incredibly scared that my youngest will eventually start acting like this as well. One difficult child is enough. 

This has also put a huge strain on our marriage. We’ve been together 12 years. This man is my best friend my soulmate…and this has created such a rough patch in our marriage. When it’s just us or there’s a good day we’re fine. But when our oldest decides to have a bad day everyone has a bad day. We’re both have so many other things on our plates(jobs, economy, mental health, etc) that stress us out already. To put this on top of all that? It’s becoming too much. 

Today was good up until they decided to openly disobey us and tried to get their sibling to follow along. Tonight was super important for my husband as he has an important test for his job tomorrow. He’s been studying when he can since Christmas. He was at the store grabbing a few things when my eldest decided they were so frustrated with me telling them what to do that they had their arm raised ready to throw their snow boot at me. I just sat there and asked them over and over “if that hits my face then what? How would that make you feel?” And they said happy…it would make them happy to see me hurt…they finally put the boot down and I kept asking them and they kept saying happy so I recorded them and showed my husband later. He was so upset with them and tried talking with them to the point where he got so upset he just went to bed at supper time…it’s now my oldest bedtime and I’ve managed to kind of talk with them about everything that went wrong tonight and I think I’ve gotten through to them on some things. I apologized for my parts and they did apologize as well. They also said they would be sad if I got hurt by throwing their boot at me. I’m still just so heartbroken that this is our daily lives. And I’m worried about my husband and his test tomorrow. And I myself am sad that all I ever wanted was to be a mom and now I hate it…I wasn’t cut out for this and I can’t help but think about the life my husband and I missed out on and how happy we could’ve been without kids…I love my kids so much…but…I’m scared I’m going to end up resenting one or both of them…",Likely mother: 11 > 0
15 January 2025,Over opinionated daughter,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i1k7b0/over_opinionated_daughter/,"Forgive me if I don’t hit all the rules here I just want opinions and potential advice from outside my normal circle. My background info. I was raised in rural Tennessee by a hippy woman, and her husband that mass produced methamphetamines. Even though she was a hippy they were wildly violent and would just simply beat the piss out of me for the mildest violations. Fast forward oh, about 20 years and I meet this wonderful woman who already had sons. (Ages 3 and 6 months) I was petrified. I went and got 5 or 6 books and child rearing because I knew what I experienced was not normal. Got a lot of good info and basically just did the opposite of everything that was ever done to me. The boys have grown into outstanding, well mannered young men. About 7 years into our relationship my wife began (forcefully) stating she wanted to have my child. I was scared to death. The boys were not genetically mine and surely my genes are poisoned by generations of abuse. I completely cave and we have a daughter. Been wrapped around her finger since she was born. She is now 16 and drives me absolutely fucking crazy. She exhibits behaviors my sons never did. She knows everything, her outspoken opinions are the only things that matter and heaven forbid I ever try to offer any fatherly advice because well she fucking knows everything. My wife began to complain about her behavior, as well as my sons. I keep taking this bombardment of teenage angst for roughly a year and just finally one day in the middle of an argument with my wife I simply told her “to shut the fuck up” I lost my temper and those were the words that were spoken. Everyone acted like I committed this unforgivable act and “how dare I talk to her this way” etc….. now that she has been both defended and justified her behavior has gotten worst And I am put in a position where I dont even want to talk to her because if I am honest with her surely more monstrous words will spill out of my mouth. So I know have a daughter I don’t even wish to speak with. How far was I out of line?

14 January 2025,Trying to start a company with toddlers,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i0zwxe/trying_to_start_a_company_with_toddlers/,"After all my life working for a boss, I finally got a good idea and actually building it (software). I've done my market research and it seems like there is a need. It gives me a lot of energy to work on. I would love to make it market ready and reach out to companies to sell it (which I know is more soul crushing than I would hope it to be). And not unimportant: it could potentially land us some more money than just our jobs.

But when to build? On the days my wife works, I have the kids and there are small windows for my brain to think of the things I need to do, or some ideas to improve the software. Then rush hour starts: eating, not wanting to sleep, etc etc. And when they finally sleep I am wrecked. All day I was looking forward to work on my project, and when I finally can - I just can't bring up the energy to do a little thing.  
On the day I work for my boss it similar. I come home and instantly start the catering/nursing shift that lasts until 7:30. When they're finally in bed, I'm just done.

It's just hard to do this in between everything and go way, way slower than I would like. So many times I am burning of energy to work on my project. In such a state I can do tons of work! But I can't because I'm standing in a playground, shoveling sand. Which in turn I do not give the attention it should get. I also know when the company actually starts it will be the same again. I want or need to spend time on it, but my kids take up all my time and energy. All though they will be in school by then. 

End of rant how my own goal, that would very much serve our family in the end, is inching forward because all my time and energy is directed to the kids.",Likely father: 1 > 0
14 January 2025,A deeply profound mistake,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1i0v1zc/a_deeply_profound_mistake/,"I have a 3 year old boy. We dealt with colic for the first 5 months of his life, which were dark times for both me and my partner. During that period, I had the first thought that I’d made a terrible mistake - I realised that I had brought a child into this world apparently only to suffer. We couldn’t do anything to alleviate his  discomfort - not for lack of trying - and I wondered whether “this” was better than not being at all.

The stress of that time took its toll on us as parents, and I‘m sure we both aged 10 years in the space of 5 months and probably are dealing with some degree of PTSD to this day. I’ve realised that we rolled the dice - our child is now healthy pending a likely future ADHD diagnosis, but we could have just as easily ended up with a child with a severe mental disability, chronic pain, childhood cancer, personality disorder, or any other number of conditions that would reduce his quality of life.

He’s a toddler so we’ve been struggling with the usual - defiance, early wakeups, tantrums, relationship strain. People have said to try and include your children in the things you enjoy, so the other day I put on some music while sitting with him and playing with play-dough. He immediately tantrums and tells me to turn the music off, after which he decides to throw my drink on the floor, sending glass everywhere. Another time, I tried taking him on a hike but less than 10 minutes in, we are dealing with a tantrum and demands to go home. I understand this is developmentally normal, but where is the joy? Both me and my son are miserable, and my attempts to inject some enjoyment into life only lead to more negativity. 

There are a few moments where he smiles, or seems to be interested in something, but the majority of his time is spent in a state of restlessness or dissatisfaction (whining and demanding). I try to enjoy those positive moments, but they are fleeting - gone in an instant - whereas the negativity seems to go on and on, day after day, hour after hour. In some cosmic way it makes sense. If somehow, prior to birth, we knew that we would come into a world where things like the holocaust are possible, where children are being blown to pieces in Gaza, where death and disease are inevitable, would we be happy with the choice our parents made to bring us into existence?

Also, isn’t it true that we are never truly satisfied? If we were satisfied with existing ‘as-is’, then why would we go out into the world and chase money, romance, status, relationships and family?

I understand this is all very pessimistic, and there are some joys in life that appear to make all this worthwhile - things like love, music, success in work/sport/hobbies, art, beauty of nature, and whatever else humans value - but none of this is a given, and attaining or appreciating any of these parts of life requires him to “play the game” of fitting into society. I think about the trials and struggles he will go through as he passes through years of school and work, with no guarantee that he will find the things that make life worthwhile. As much as I can try to shield him from failure and despair, it may all be in vain. 

So, I realise I’ve made a terrible and selfish mistake by bringing him into this world. I am regretful not for myself, but for my son who had no say in whether he wanted to be here or not. I now have a duty to try as best I can to give him the tools and the best chance to find happiness, but I should not be surprised if he is unable to do so. In the meantime, I will keep reading to him, playing with him, teaching him as best I can about the way of the world, try to introduce him to the beautiful parts of life, in spite of his negativity and dissatisfaction with existence. But I won’t make the same mistake again.",Unclear: 0 / 0

I was organizing my closet yesterday and ran across my son's (9, profoundly autistic) baby book. He was planned, and his father and I were so in love and had been for 13 years or so. We're divorced now.

I'm tearing up just trying to write about it. I wrote about how wanted he was. How he was the best thing that ever happened to us. I wrote his milestones (he was always ahead in the physical ones), and how I thought he was going to be intelligent and successful. I'm by no means calling him unintelligent, but I guess I thought he'd be like me, an overachiever. 

I was filled with hope and joy for the future. You can't really tell a child is autistic in the first year or two. I had no idea. I wrote with humor how he cried all the time and how tired I was. I guess it's been so hard, I can't really remember back to the days when I wasn't regretful. 

Anyways, it's been on my mind since last night and I just had to vent.

She’s loved and was wanted, but I realized early on that I hate motherhood. The constant regret never fades. She’s always been a defiant and hard child to raise, and her behavior as a teen, especially with her emotional instability and impulsiveness, has made it hell. Last year was the worst with multiple  attempts to end herself, ER visits, psych hospitals, and failed therapies. Medication is helping, meds aren’t magic pills. We still have a lot of struggles. 

I feel ill-equipped to raise a teen. I’ve done everything I can, from moving to a better school district that supports kids with autism, spending more quality time with her, going above and beyond to make sure she has a good upbringing and good experiences. We have good times too. I dote on her and we laugh and joke, etc. Yet somehow I still feel like I don’t know what I’m doing being a mom. I’m not much of a disciplinarian. I’m probably more lenient with certain things than I should be and I feel like I can’t manage her. I am tired and worn out most times. The daily toll of mothering is overwhelming. I’m doing this alone with no support system. We lost her father and my father both to cancer 3 months apart when she was only 3 yrs old. Her paternal grandmother died when she was 3 mths.

At least not while doing it alone. My sons father was/is abusive so we split. order of protection was put  in place and he moved to another state 

How easy do the fathers have it right ?? 


Haven’t put him on child support yet because i was waiting for him to show me he can be responsible with helping us with financial support. Realized how big of a mistake that was now. ( plus he’s working off the books so not much luck there) 

Was living with my sons father before, during and a couple weeks after my pregnancy. I was abused in front of my son when he was 4 weeks old ( not to mention I was also 4 weeks post-partum with stitches in my vagina) his parents watched him abuse and did absolutely nothing.

And I ended up going into a DV shelter December 2023 to October 2024 finally got my own little place thank god I went through so much being in  the shelter as well. 

I truly feel this man ruined everything for me my first time experience being a mom I will never get that back instead of me having the best memories as a first time mom I have the worst ones.
 Dealing with trauma PTSD Post- partum Depression post- partum rage all while trying to raise this little guy and it hurts so much because I know I’m not the best mom I can be rn I feel like I don’t deserve him and it would’ve been better  off for the both of us  I had I not  gone through with this pregnancy.

Too late for that now. 💔

Not to mention Im young I had him when I was 19 I just turned 22 now. I have a 15M old and I don’t have much family support I’m the first in my family to have a baby None of my siblings understand , can’t expect them to either when none of them have kids. so I have no one to relate to except for my “mom” , but she doesn’t give much support which I’m not surprised. 

Me and her always had a terrible 
Relationship I honestly thought the baby would bring us closer but if anything it makes me want to push away from her even more. It’s like she knows how bad I’m struggling and turns a blind eye.  we can have a conversation and I could tell her about how stressed out I am & me  needing a break and she’s just one of those moms that’ll tell you “ well I went through it too” “ I didn’t have support” “my siblings didn’t help me either.” “ this is the life when having  kids & doing it by yourself. ”( mom raised 6 kids on her own )  it’s like she’s basically saying if she struggled I gotta struggle too. Which I don’t understand !!! Why would you want that for your own daughter!! 

for you to see your own daughter struggling badly  and you don’t have that sense of urgency to help and support her because you never received it yourself. I will never freaking understand that. It makes me hate my life so much and the family I was born into. 

My life isn’t even my life anymore everything is about my son I hardly have time to myself.  Everything pisses me off when dealing with my son.  If he throws food on the floor,  knocks something down,  I’m already yelling I feel like I’m literally drowning but still trying to  get through the days.

I tried to get help with a therapist and psychiatrist but it’s scary dealing with them one wrong word or sentence they’ll dial CPS it’s like you can’t even be fully honest with them about how you feel 100% cuz then your “ unfit to be a mother”  I know with everything that I’m sharing I basically am but I it’s not like I’m not trying I still push myself everyday to take care of him , feed him , bathe him, play with him even if it’s for 3 mins 😣😣 I just feel so fucking awful and I miss my old life so much I was just getting started can’t really blame anyone but myself but I don’t get why things have to be this way 😔😔 I thought this would’ve changed my life for the better but I feel it’s made things worse. I was actually very happy and excited when having my baby but with the abuse and everything that came after that it just ruined everything for me.

I never realized that saying that’s always said “ It takes a village to raise a child “ till now and realizing I don’t have that supportive village breaks my fucking heart. Especially for my son. 

Now I understand why some women stay most of the time or want to work things out with the other parent because having both parents in the home is crucial when raising a child both parents are definitely needed ! It brings that balance that is needed. ( But who am I kidding nowadays you have 2 parents in the household and it’s really 1 carrying all the weight and responsibility.) 

I just want things to get better instead of me cherishing these little moments with my son knowing I can’t get this time back …I’m over here wishing I didn’t have him and can’t wait for him to start school 💔😢

SB- I don’t have a car , I have to  take public transportation, living in NYC Im scared to go anywhere with my son tbh . I’m basically a stay at home mom relying on government assistance. 
& I Don’t trust day cares until my son can talk and tell me what someone has done to him. So with that comes with the sacrifice of not being able to work.

Has anyone else come to this conclusion?

Reading posts here makes me empathize with thier feelings of not really wanting us but also sad. It affects generations. It's like throwing a pebble in a pond. There's nothing the ripples don't touch. A part of me wishes they could just be honest about it. ""Hey I didn't really want you or even like you very much but on some level I loved you."" (Which is why I did my best to care for you). I could grieve that. Move on. Choose to go no contact. They don't owe me anything and I don't owe them anything. I could accept the truth. It will hit like a 9mm to the gut but I could accept that. Heal it and move on.

For context parenting has not come naturally to me. My son had colic and would scream at me all day long and the nights have me anxiety. I then went through domestic abuse at the hands of his father when he was born and soon became a single parent so I’ve been raising him alone basically from when he was born. 

When he was 6 months old I took on agency work to survive as welfare wasn’t enough. Previously before that I was working at a good job doing important things and I have degree as well. 

I lost my identity. 

He’s now 4 years old and not going to school yet until a few months on. The wait is draining right now because I really need the support right now and my family are not much help.

His dad’s side are great don’t get me wrong. His dad has him every weekend Friday to Sunday and on Sunday I pick him up (2 nights). 

Right now I work nights doing tarot card readings on a self employed basis so I work 6 days a week from 9pm till 1am in the morning to avoid child fees I cannot afford so I do this while my sons asleep thank god he’s a good sleeper or I wouldn’t be able to work like this. It’s leaving me snappy, irritated, tired and Ive had enough. 

I hate how I am with him. Im not depressed I know what that looks like because I’m prone to it but I do suffer with anxiety and I am very sensitive to sounds so the constant noise during the day he makes with his toys and the tv on or the tantrums set me off. 

I shout, I purposely go to my bedroom to avoid the noise because I don’t want to make him play in his bedroom because that isn’t fair it’s his home too.

I don’t want to spend time with him anymore this has been doing on for well over a year so maybe two years now. I’ve dreamed of running away but I won’t leave my child because I do love him and I come from a abusive home so I wouldn’t put him into the care system and his dad doesn’t have the responsibility to be an active parent and manage what I do day to day. 

I have ALOT of resentment regarding how my life has been because I was a high flying career women making a path. I wanted my son he was planned. 
I just had a very different idea to motherhood. 

It’s not that I hate being a single parent I really don’t I just hate the fact I don’t have enough financial resources to make it comfortable for myself like hiring a nanny and outsourcing the load so I’m not constantly stressed. 

I hate parenting so I avoid it when I can and the two days his dad has him or even some holidays (we split them) I can’t wait to take him there so he can just leave me alone. 

I hate the tantrums, I feel instantly irritated when he starts I have no patience so I send him to his room or if we’re out I snap verbally at him. I don’t want to give him affection, I feel touched out and overstimulated due to the constant noise 5 days a week and not having my own space which only
Comes at night when he’s asleep but it’s short be used I work 6 days a week nights. 

I’m not being a good parent I know this and I realised today that while I love my child I don’t like being a parent with limited resources. I hate parts of my life and how much I have to plan around my kid yet his dad doesn’t want to do 50/50 or can’t I should say we don’t live near each other. 

So I’m left with 20 days of parenting a month while he has a whole 4 days a week not worrying about childcare, providing a small amount of money because he chooses to do a low paid job and he only does 8 days a month of childcare (2 days a week). He won’t do during the week which is genuinely what would help me not feel so suffocated. 

Overall I have made a mistake having child of realising just how motherhood has restricted me from being myself, I’ve completely lost myself. 

I don’t have access to weekly childcare for a weekly break apart from three mornings when he at nursery and I choose to sleep because I work at night. At night I work so I don’t have downtime unless it’s Saturday night or Sunday night. 

I cannot change his dads situation and I have accepted that our co parenting will only be during some of the holidays and two nights a week so nothing can be done about that and I have no one to ask either for extra help.

I really struggle and as someone who comes from trauma I don’t want to make my son feel unwanted and I know he prefers his dad in the affection department because of how I come across 

I’m one and done so I won’t be making any silly decisions but how can I live with what I’ve done when I have so limited resources and childcare ?",Likely mother: 9 > 1

I remember her telling me years ago that she was done and didn't want more kids. Yesterday she told me she was pregnant again, and it was completely unplanned because she was on birth control. I asked her if she was happy about it, and she said she was still adjusting to the idea of it, but that her husband definitely didn't want more. Honestly? I felt so incredibly sorry for her when she announced her pregnancy.  She got through and was well past the most difficult part of raising kids (though it never gets easy). Her kids are older and not as needy anymore as a newborn and a toddler. Plus, she told me her kids were always easy even as babies, and now she's worried this baby will not be the same. She sounded worried about keeping her job, too. Plus, she expressed concern about being an older mom at 38 years old. She didn't seem that happy. I was trying to be happy for her, but as soon as she told me she was pregnant, the first thought that crossed my mind was how sorry I felt for her. I did tell her after my pregnancy complications and after dealing with how difficult my son is, I was 💯 certain I was done and didn't want more. We live in a state where abortion isn't allowed, and it sounds like she's too far along. She'd have to travel to a different state. I can't be happy for her. She and her husband didn't want more kids. Plus, talking from firsthand experience, having a baby when you're closer to 40 is a terrible idea. She sounded overwhelmed honestly. I don't know why I'm posting in here. I have never enjoyed motherhood, and don't know when I'll get to start enjoying it. Things are still very difficult. I see pregnant women and just feel bad for them. I don't even want to be near pregnant women. It brings back too many bad memories for me (my pregnancy nearly killed me).

",https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1hw455k/my_wife_wanted_a_child_the_child_was_born_with_a/,"My wife and I have been together for 12 years. She always knew my stance on children and was aware that I didn’t want to have any.

We built a house and lived a beautiful, carefree life, but suddenly, all her friends started getting pregnant one after another.

The topic of having a child kept coming up more and more often, leading to serious arguments between us.

I kept emphasizing that I didn’t want to dedicate my entire life to taking care of a child, and I was terrified of the worst-case scenario: that our child would be born sick. Every day, I was bombarded with pictures of cute babies and reassurances from my wife that she would handle everything and that I would be able to pursue my passions and live as before.

The grandparents promised they would do everything – help out, cook, clean.

God, how naive I was. I agreed.

At the end of the pregnancy, our child was diagnosed with a heart defect that would require two surgeries.

From that moment on, nothing was the same – my worst nightmare had come true.

Waiting for our son to be born and for his first heart surgery, followed by his recovery, was the worst period of my life. The amount of stress we faced during that time made us age several years in just a few months.

As of now, we are waiting for the second surgery.

Our son is in very good condition – unlike my wife.

After giving birth, she fell into a deep depression. She attends psychotherapy and takes psychiatric medication, but I haven’t seen any positive effects from it.

She spends most of her day in bed, doesn’t clean, doesn’t cook, and tries to take care of the baby, but our son is very energetic, and frankly, she simply doesn’t have the strength to keep up with him.

Because of this whole situation, I changed jobs to one that allows me to work remotely. I take care of our child for most of the day. When the baby naps, I start working, and in between, I clean up the mess and cook meals.

I sleep three hours a night, and I’m slowly running out of strength. I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this.

Every morning, I wake up and think about how my life could have looked and how it looks now.

I feel like crying, but I grit my teeth and keep going for my son – I owe him that.

I’m writing this post because there are often people here who don’t have children yet, and maybe this post will help them make a decision.

**To sum up:**

    •	Don’t believe what you see on the internet or on TV. Raising a child is not easy or fun – it’s hard, 24/7 work.
    
    •	Don’t fall for promises that others (grandparents) will help – they won’t. They just want to show off their grandkids to others.
    
    •	Don’t assume your child will be born healthy – there’s no guarantee.

Frequent hospital visits have made me realize just how many children today suffer from various diseases.

Momma to a 9, almost 10 year old profoundly autistic son, that has self injurious behaviors and sensory Processing disorder. Also PICA, and on and off poop play.

I'd mentioned THC about a month ago. I took the leap and got him put on the compassion use registry of Texas (CURT). Picked up his first bottle of tincture 2 weeks ago. Started it immediately.

In that time though, before we acquired the prescription THC, he'd been switched to Zyprexa as his aggression medication. We did the genetic testing to see which meds he could metabolize. Zyprexa was one. We saw pretty immediate results. Far less meltdowns, far less SIB. But still anxious and triggered by wanting food all the time (Zyprexa substantially increases appetite).

So believe it or not, the THC has helped him stop fixating on junk food. It also helps him calm down before bedtime. When he does have a meltdown, it's usually less violent and shorter in length.

As far as daily meltdowns, I tried .5 mL, but didn't see a HUGE difference. It's not had an adverse effects, but also not really any big changes. So we'll likely increase the dose slightly.

I will say, things are getting easier. I cry way less now. I'm still going to work on trying to ease the anxiety. We still can't go anywhere, but at home, he's generally happy.

He's gotten more affectionate, as the Abilify made him where he was not interested in affection. He cuddles and hangs out with us in the living room more. He doesn't dig in his pull up like he was, but I'm still dealing with him getting poop on his hands and wiping it on himself.",Unclear: 0 / 0

This is why family members don't naturally want to play their roles (I just made a previous post about family members playing their roles).
Unless you come from a healthy family or your partner does...stay away from having children. 
You will need you time. 
You will need to play *just mom* (your role)
You will need to play *just dad* (your role)
You will need grandma to be grandma.. grandpa to be grandpa etc (but they usually don't want to be because they became grandparents at the age of 35 and don't want to play that role yet...or they may be exhausted from raising you and want a break).
Those are usually the dysfunctional ones. 
You don't need to play... grandpa.. grandma..auntie.. uncle etc. 
You only need to play your part..for your sanity. 

You really can't expect anybody on earth to want to be there for your kids. (It's not ok but it's a cruel and ugly world we live in... a solid family will have your back no matter what and I'm sure you will have theirs too). 
You will need healthy people to help navigate this road with you ..so you don't go crazy and the kids can have someone outside of you teaching them things.

Most people are dysfunctional and come from dysfunction so they don't understand what it means to be good family members. They don't even know what it's like to have a family.
People are not obligated to help you (good .. healthy people will because they are more understanding and they know what family means).
If you want a village to be there...you will definitely have to have a talk with your family before you have a kid (although people can talk good and still not do what they say ..this is usually if the people are dysfunctional..if you come from a great family..you won't have to explain anything because they are naturally prepared to play their roles and are excited to do so).
Please don't put yourself in the position of being a parent unless you and your partner have amazing families first. 
Kids need more than one (healthy) person raising them.
They need a family. 

We feel regretful when we come from dysfunction and are in this alone. 
We have to live with our decisions of pushing a child out because it's something we decided to do.
You should own that part but understand that life is not supposed to be this way for parents. 
You need healthy support.

Edit: For those of you who do not have kids yet and are scrolling to see why you shouldn't...check the comment section. You can't expect certain family members to ever be excited about being anything to your kids. There are certain people who do not understand or want to engage in being a family.

The loss of Me happened after a rough year with a horrible boss, and the same year I found my husband. I got pregnant very quickly and now we have a 2yo and 4yo.

Before kids, I loved reading, the silence around me, getting lost in art, crafting and getting out for walks or on my bike.
I am in general a very low energy person, I don't enjoy adrenalin rushes or doing a lot of things every day. I am and always has been completely satisfied just being at home the whole weekend with a good book, audiobook/podcast and just not say a word to anyone, just crafting or spending time alone at my pace. I worked mon-fri 6am to 6pm at that time, with a longer lunch break between 12-3 pm.

This is where the kids happened and everything changed and where Me dissappeared.

Nothing is quiet and calm anymore and I feel terribly stressed and overwhelmed. Every day is a fricking marathon, from 5:30am to 8pm and I'm totally exhausted by the time I leave the kids to daycare in the morning after 45mins of trying to get them dressed and out the door. And, as you well know the day isn't over at 8 am. First I have to work full time and then It's time to rush to daycare to pick up hangry and speed up kids, then home to cook and them bedtime routine. And the youngest wake up about 3 times every night, and I have to deal with it every night.
I hate everything about this life and I don't want it anymore.

And the next morning he said he was tired, after sleeping the whole night through. And I effing lost it and we've been not talking since. I told him I've been tired for 4 years, and he said he didn't want me to compare our tiredness, only to validate it for him.

05 January 2025,Want to leave ~ breathe,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1htsgxf/want_to_leave_breathe/,"Hi everyone, 

Just writing this in the middle of the night because I'm so overwhelmed, I can't sleep again. My kids are 2years and 9months old, and while I know I love them with all my heart, I cannot feel it. 

There is such a disconnect between what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling. My husband is doing everything he can, he shows up a 1000% and I do not blame him, or feel any type of negativity towards him. But still I feel the disconnect with everyone around me. 

Due to both pregnancies I had a postpartum depression, and am still in the last one, and I still have trouble controlling my bladder too (idk how to say this normal in English). It occurs daily that I have to run to the bathroom if I feel that I need to pee. 

I never wanted kids myself. 
Firstly, because I could never envision myself with kids and there was no boyfriend who ever made me change my mind. 
Secondly, I feared that becoming a mother/having a pregnancy would trigger another depression. 
Thirdly, the fact that I did want to accomplish certain academic goals (getting a PhD in foreign country) which would be highly strenuous during motherhood. 
Fourthly, there was the fact that I did not want to sacrifice a relationship to having kids. 
And fifthly, I saw one of my best friends struggle with a husband who is nearly never home and I just got terrified.

Then I met my now-husband. Everything changed because I realised that he was my person. From the first date I told him I didn't want to have kids, and he was okay with that. After a few years, I asked him and after I pressed him, he answered honestly that he really did want to have kids. And slowly, I could see us, having a little boy who looked exactly like his father. And we talked about having kids more often. I told him my fears of depression, everything and he took away all my oppositions. I told him the only way I'm going to have kids, is if we do it 50-50. And in terms of taking care of the kids, even more skewed because I've learned that I need time for myself. He agreed happily and we decided that if we had the option, I'd be the breadwinner and he'd work part-time and take care of the kids. He was so looking forward to it and I was looking forward to it too. 

We decided that we'd love to have 2 kids (if we were blessed enough to conceive), I personally know a few kids without siblings and almost all are quite egoistic, otherwise I would've wanted only one. I told my husband I would prefer to have twins or if that didn't happen, getting pregnant immediately after the first so that I would be done with being pregnant as fast as possible and time would be less lost as the diaper-period would overlap more. 

Then, my eldest (crybaby) was born, and I had 4 inflammations of the breasts (due to breastfeeding) and all these antibiotics again and again and the bleeding during the breastfeeding, I was done. There was this little human, that I was supposed to take care of and the only thing I could hear was the crying for God knows what reason, that made me nearly want to leave for good. Postpartum depression then. 4 months after I get pregnant with the youngest and my mother passes away in a traumatic manner which I have PTSD from and have sufficiently reduced that with EMDR. 

To be honest, I felt like I was being punished and I still do (dont know what for though -.-). Why do I have to get all this extra baggage because I have to get pregnant? Why do I have to sacrifice my mental health and physical wellbeing in order for us to have kids? Maybe this is a ""victim attitude"" and I detest myself for it, because you just gotta shut up and keep on working hard in order to earn what you want to achieve. But I don't understand why it has to be me? Why does my mum have to leave me so soon in such an unfair way? 

Then again, my kids are not the problem, but I still hold them accountable (which in itself is obviously ridiculous) for falling down (and then crying) when trying to stand, or getting jealous when I read a book with the other kid. I'm so empty inside. I want my kids to feel loved, I want to feel myself loving my kids, but instead I resent them for draining the only bit of energy I have everyday. 

Tbh, I don't want to hear anyone breathing around me. I just want to lie with my head under the blankets and be alone and feel nothing. 

Instead, I feel this immense pain and fatigue (in the living corpse-range). I cry when I drop something (which is often as I am tired). When my youngest holds my hand and subsequently gets his dirty peanutbutterfingers all over my new t-shirt (new because hello 30kg weight gain due to stress eating), I cry so hard that I need to take a 10 minute break because now I have to look up how to remove peanutbutter stains out of a t-shirt. 

So now, instead of working, I'm home ill everyday and the only thing I have energy for is the bare minimum, unloading the dishwasher, getting groceries and cooking, that is if the kids are away. If they are at home, I am exhausted by 8 in the morning (2 hours after getting up). 

And I almost forgot the constant need for emotional regulation from the kids. I cannot even control my own emotions because exhaustion, and now I have to comfort you when you fall off the couch after I tell you 20 times to sit your butt down (whilst feeding the youngest and so having my hands full)?

I'm done. I'm really done. Maybe being a parent is nicer when you are mentally okay, but everyday I want to run and hide somewhere far away and just sleep. Hearing my own thoughts. Doing what I want for a change. Spending my time and energy on improving my academic skills, paint, read a book, visit a museum, get fit. 

But no, I get to be imprisoned every day, being drained of all my energy and life over and over again. And I choose to fight for my family every time again by not leaving them behind, but it doesn't get better. 

It keeps on happening. The crying, the meltdowns, the illnesses and colds. 

When will this be over? Why can't I just leave? When will it get better? When can I just breathe without having the feeling of gasping for air?

The measures I am coming up for now to have 2025 not be another epic post kid shit show and potentially staying as an intact family are:

1)
Starting my gym membership and go there 5 am for an hour 3x a week. I can use boxing bags to punch out any of my frustration and just physically exhaust myself from my lived misery.

2) 
Just doing more work and hiding in work. Going on more conferences and weekend work trips, so I am less at home. Earning more revenue to potentially rent even office space, so I have a place to go and be away from home (currently running remote company working from home). Earning more money to rent nannies once in a while. 


Sorry if this reads bonkers, but I will implement this and observe if this will help my mode and overall well-being with my trapped life at home...

I deeply love my husband, but I resent that I had kids for him. Though, this was my fault, I am still responsible for my own happiness.

I hate this life so, so much. Every fucking single day being there for others. Kid just woke up and 5 minutes later has a meltdown. Can you not even not cry in my ears shortly after waking up and biggering me to do shit for you??

Can I not for once just sleep in or just straight up work without interruption and making sure everyone is fed and changed and dressed?

I had such a beautiful life pre kids and now everything evolves around their needs (I know this is normal, because they literally are dependent, but for gods sake when do I get a break?)

I am so mad and sad and frustrated and have so much anger in me that I did this for a man.

The kids deserve well regulated parents, but for me this means I need to play a role. I play a role of being attentive, being calm, pretending I care about reading the same stupid book 10x in a row, playing the same puzzle 10x in a row... I am so fucking bored out of my mind. 

There is zero intellectual stimulation. It's just playing a fucking role of trying to be a good mom so they don't become fuck ups and have a good life.

But I sincerely doubt how much longer I can do this while living in the same apartment.

If I only had 4 days a week I could recharge and actually work... then this break would allow me to save up my battery and be more of this parent they deserve.

I am sincerely thinking I should sacrifice my marriage for the sake of my own health and making the best out of the mistake of agreeing to have kids.

Now i know alot of you will think, “of course its going to be hard in the newborn phase” but these feelings have been a long time coming.

For both my kids i did not feel that overwhelming warm feeling of love when i first met my babies, if im to be truly honest i am still waiting for that feeling… what i did feel however is a deep sense of responsibility (and with that a fair dose of dread)

I would say that before having kids my parenting resume would have looked fairly decent… kind, compassionate, responsible, driven and protective. Aswell as this alot of people told me i would make a great father.

Three years into parenting i have realised i also possess some traits that are not really conducive to being a parent. High expectations for compliance, little patience for non compliance and a need for down time. I do try my very best to not be so rigid on these, but i dont feel like im really getting anywhere they are so engrained.

So obviously my 3 year old is a very high energy, stubborn, defiant boy who for some reason really butts heads with me. He hits and scratches me when im trying to get him to do a task, he refuses to allow me to try and get him to sleep and he calls me by my first name alot. Its driving me insane and really making me not have a nice relationship with him, im always angry, frustrated and yelling at him… i juat might add he is pretty much a sweetheart with everyone else and a complete mommas boy.

We really ummed and ahhed about have baby2 (a girl) but bit the bullet in the end, thinking we could do it and wanting to provide baby1 with a sibling. I was stupid, i played my chances on baby 2 being a lot easier than baby 1 as i thought i could not deal with another baby 1.

Anyway fast forward, baby 2 is 6 weeks old and has pretty much cried and screamed (when awake) for that 6 weeks… and to add to that baby 1 has really amped up with me since the birth (i dont know why)

Tonight we went for a walk with the kids about 5pm, baby2 started crying then and has not stopped (only for brief moments) and it is now 11.16pm and baby1 was running around not allowing us to put him to bed until 10pm… im exhausted, ive got nothing else to give and im really starting to resent my kids and feel like this is my life now a life of pain and suffering.

I will just add, i think the resentment feeling comes harder and faster because i put SO much time and energy into trying to remedy my relationship with the kids, i have even been prioritising them over work… to no avail. Im finding it just too hard.",Likely father: 1 > 0

02 January 2025,16 months post partum vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1hs5b5y/16_months_post_partum_vent/,"Hi, its me again after a while.
You can read in my post history that I had a daughter in university because Im an idiot. 

Now its 16 months since she crawled out of my vagina. I started university again in october. Its been really tiring, my mom watches her once a week and my bf also once a week, so I can go to school twice a week and do my stuff. 


Now its exam season so im home full time again except for exams. 
We really need a daycare, the one in town is full but we will go there in two weeks and hopefully they will find a spot for us at least once a week. 

In my country it is not normal to have a child younger than 3yo in daycare so many people judge us hard for even considering this option. Probably a reason why we waited with it for so long. But we cant go on like this..

My daughter is super attached to me though so i worry she will hate it there. 

How am I doing?? 

Im super depressed. I thought i will be happier when im studying again and while im glad i have this option, its been quite hard on me. Basically I only take care of my kid or study. Thats it. Also im just sad that Im stuck. My bf is a good dude but I could date like 5, 6 more men if i wanted to. Now I will never know anyone else bcs im saggy mom covered in fucking stretch marks. 
I feel like im in prison. 

People ask me if i have friends in uni again and the long answer is NO. I dont Brenda, i mean im used to being alone so whatever. Thanks for another reminder how big of a loser I am tho.

People just look down on me when they learn i have a kid, its better when nobody knows.

I had 2 days long mental breakdown bcs i miss living w my parents even though it wasnt that great too but at least I wasnt constantly wanted/needed by someone. 

Also i love my kid shes an angel BUT its quite boring or exhausting taking care of her. I could still handle that tho, the worst part is the neverending responsibility and worry. Like i cant handle the fact she might get hurt in the future or something. Just this fact alone makes me regretful. That I gave her life full of pain. Hopefully she will have a good life but we all suffer so you know what i mean. At least now shes quite happy kid or so it seems.",Likely mother: 4 > 0

While she loves being a mom, I struggle to share that sentiment. I value my freedom and personal ambitions, making it difficult to fully embrace parenthood.

Communicating these feelings has been challenging. Over the past six years, our discussions often lead to emotional invalidation, with her dismissing my perspective. I don’t seek to be right or wrong; I just want to be understood.

The possibility of separation has surfaced, making the situation feel more real. However, I am committed to doing everything in my power to save our family. If, after giving my best effort, I find that this lifestyle doesn’t align with who I truly am, I may have to make the difficult decision to walk away.

I don’t enjoy parenting; in fact, I find it extremely challenging. Being around kids has been a struggle, making this experience feel like a personal hell.

Despite the difficulties, I’m hopeful that my wife and I can find a compromise and develop solutions. Having these feelings out in the open is a relief, as it means we both recognize that something needs to change.

Blunt truth:,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1hqf9zt/how_do_i_say_this_nicely_blunt_truth/,"My son (10) is someone who, if I wasn’t obligated by law and biology to take care of, I would have nothing to do with.  Like any other person who acts like he does would be blocked and ignored out of my life with a swiftness and left in the dust by any and all means necessary.  

He is diagnosed ADHD, likely on the autism spectrum (evaluation pending) and he displays every characteristic of ODD and/or PDA to a T.  He is an impossibly difficult child and though I have empathy for his unasked for neurodivergence and understanding that he’s “having a hard time”, I’m only human and my empathy and understanding has its limits, which he pushes his way past every day.  he isn’t stupid and he knows full well the difference between right and wrong, what is and isn’t acceptable behavior, and he puts less than zero effort into implementing ANY of the tools and strategies given to him by his parents, his teachers, his therapist.  In a nutshell, it’s HIS WAY or the highway (or else), full stop, and fuck you if you try to alter that plan.  And if you try to give him any kind of consequences for his absurd and atrocious actions?  Fuck you twice and by the way I hope you know you’re worse than Hitler and you will PAY for your insolence. 

Yes he deals with anxiety and emotional disregulation - he’s also smart, knows he is neurodivergent, and milks that for all it’s worth in extremely manipulative ways, so that he is never actually held accountable for his worst impulses and somehow - some fucking how - gets it “his way” in the end, against all standards of sanity and common human decency.  People think it’s terrible for me to even notice that, much less say it out loud, but come live in my house for a week.  He holds his whole family hostage this way.  

Yes I’m venting but I’m also VERY worried about his future.  At this rate I see it being very lonely at best, if not possibly even criminal.  He has less than zero interest or intention to ever be held to any kind of standards or to acclimate in any way that doesn’t involve himself as the center of the universe where everyone else serves at his pleasure.  

Is there a sweet kid underneath all his awfulness?  Yes, absolutely there is. I think it’s his true and original nature.  It’s the only thing that keeps me trying to fight FOR him.  I try soooo hard to cultivate that.  It’s there when what he wants happens to line up with what is fine and acceptable to the other people in his family.  The moment he hears “no” however… fight bell rings and he comes out bobbing and weaving and throwing jabs to intimidate, then when that doesn’t work out come the haymakers and when that doesn’t work it’s a scorched earth policy that doesn’t relent regardless of any consequences until he either gets us to just give up out of sheer exhaustion or else he loses interest in the conflict and just switches off.  It’s fucking insanity, I’m telling you.

29 December 2024,suicidal thoughts starting,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1hoowdy/suicidal_thoughts_starting/,"Suicidal thoughts are starting to creep in. (36M) I have a 3.5-year-old and a 12-month-old. I’m running a stressful business venture that allows us to maintain a lifestyle in one of the top three most expensive cities in the U.S. I work a lot, and I also have personal dreams that I try to pursue. I remind myself that my kids won’t be toddlers forever, but there’s no guarantee that things will actually get easier. I love my kids, but sometimes I feel so frustrated with my toddler that I forget he’s just a 3-year-old boy.

I miss my marriage. We’re both so tired all the time, and the little time we do get together is constantly interrupted. We can’t even watch a movie as a family because my toddler either insists on something else, or the movie is too adult for him to watch. My wife is still breastfeeding the baby, which adds to the exhaustion.

I feel like I’m in survival mode, grinding it out, hoping this business takes off far beyond where it is now. From the outside, it might look like we’re doing well, and the income seems stable, but if the business doesn’t improve in the next six months, I could lose that stability.

I’m getting tired. I’ve lost my sense of style and don’t feel like myself anymore. I don’t feel cool or confident like I used to.

Sometimes, my mind drifts to darker places, wondering, What if there’s no way out? It tells me the only way out is to disappear, and then all of these troubles would be gone.

I’m so ashamed. I feel like I’ve let myself down and wonder if I was ready to have kids in the first place. I love my family deeply and want to stay with them. I don’t want to become miserable. I want to live, enjoy life, and accomplish my dreams. But sometimes, I think life would be so much easier if I didn’t have kids. Right now, they feel like an obstacle to everything I want. I feel like I traded my life and my marriage for my kids.

I’d be grateful for any advice or to hear from anyone who’s felt like this, pushed through, and found a way to love themselves and life again.

Please don’t attack me because I am actually deeply ashamed of this secret.

But I really can’t stand being around them most of the time. I am secretly joyful when they go to their dad’s house and have been even going so far as to work more so I can avoid having as much parenting time.

I divorced her dad when she was in elementary school, and I tried to model a better way of life for her. But it didn't help. All she learned is that I'm a pushover and a doormat who's fun to yell at when life disappoints you. 

I'm in therapy (of course), and my therapist says that 22-year-old people aren't done cooking yet. Her prefrontal cortex isn't fully formed. My therapist also says I need to work on dealing better with antagonistic communication and to not internalize the mean things my daughter says about me, such as: I never loved her, I don't want her to be successful, she's only ever been a disappointment to me. None of these things are true, but I'm exhausted from the constant fighting and think we should go low-contact. I feel like a punching bag. 

I know this is a common refrain (and nobody on Reddit believes it), but I did the best I could raising her on my own (first after the divorce, and then after her dad died a few years after that). I wrote her an apology letter for my mistakes, and she accepted it but continues to beat me up emotionally. We can't even have a basic conversation without it turning into a litany of complaints about how I've failed. 

So I guess I've failed. Here are I am at midlife with an adult daughter who hates me and a dead abuser hanging around me like a ghost. I feel like I ruined my life and hers. I have to get her back out of the house (she is here for Christmas and the first fight literally started at the airport) and back to her friends and her life. And then what? Try to wring some happiness out of my remaining years? I think it would be better if something happened to me, and then she could have my retirement savings now.

I want to know if more people are having the same shifty life as me because of the constant guilt for not playing with my boy as much as he requests it?

I mean he is extremely attached to me, I can not even take a shit without him crying at the door, constantly knocking so I can finish faster and get out to play with him. 

I'm already more than exhausted, and just dropped the depression pills I started to take since the parenting hit me. I got in a deep depression as I realized that I do not matter anymore, I could easily be dead for what I am concerned or my dreams are concerned, I am here just to be a slave for my kids. I accepted that, that's not the reason I am writing. 

But this constant demand of playing, he does not play alone ever. We bought the most expensive toys, he has everything he wishes, more than I could even imagine when I was a kid, but he just ignores everything, he wants me and me only, he doesn't want my wife or anybody, he wants to sleep with me, eat with me, go with me everywhere, play with me, bath with me. This morning I woke up at 7 AM and was very happy cause I could have some time for myself, I made myself a coffee, the minute I sat down at my computer to read the news he started crying cause he did not feel me in the bed and I needed to stay with him there, otherwise we would have a tantrum.

I was the one taking care of him when he was little as my wife is a fucking aggressive bitch, so I was the one making him food, washing him when he pooped, play with him, while also being in business meetings with senior stakeholders around the word as I am a corporate manager. I literally washing shit while I was in meetings. I also got fired when he was like 2 years old cause I could not handle everything, I had to take him out as in the house my wife was crazy, I skipped meetings, I had a short temper with my business partners, etc. I am taking my anger to work, my wife it's taking her crazy ass on her family but is an angel at work. I am trying to learn to love her again, but she is just despicable, always angry always unsatisfied, always disgusted.

And me, I constant feel the guilt that I am a bad parent, that my son will grow up with the feeling that I do not love him since I am always so depressed while trying to play with him constantly. I end up just laying there on the floor in his room looking at the ceiling after some minutes of play out of exhaustion. He does not even play, just just wants to see me play...

My father died when I was 12 and he was always away with his C-level job, and I always thought that I will be there for my kids when the time will come but I can not do this anymore...I fantasize of leaving every minute of my life...I feel trapped and whatever I do, it's going to be bad for my kids. If I stay I'm giving them and abandonment feeling, like my son feels, because I do not have enough energy to be as available for them as they need me to be. If I leave, they will feel abandoned again.

I’ll continue on from there.

When my husband and I arrived back from work, we had seen the house TORN up and he left to go search for her street to street. Hours went by and I told him to just come back because as many of you commented, she would be back eventually. Well, after 6 hours of searching, my husband found her on the street laying on the floor with only a tank top and shorts and we live in the east coast of the usa so it is quite cold. First of all, don’t know why she only had a tank top on. My husband attempted to bring her back home and I told him don’t I had enough. She apparently heard this and threw my husband’s phone on the concrete shattering it. Hours went by, no sleep. He came back home and told me he dropped her off to the ER.

23 December 2024,My husband and I hate being around my oldest ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1hkwt14/my_husband_and_i_hate_being_around_my_oldest/,"I (27 F) have 3 children (3 M, 6 F, 11 M). My husband (27 M) and I have been married for about 8 years now. He is the step father to my 11 year old. 

For years I had begged my oldest son’s biological father to let me put him on medication. My son tested high for depression, anxiety, ODD, ADHD, and Schizophrenia years ago. We tried therapist after therapist and nothing seemed to help. I went to a different place and they recommended medication to which his father refused. Up until last year when juvenile stepped in and his father was forced to put him on meds. At this point I had given up most of my time with my oldest due to circumstances such as; giving my daughter multiple concussions, threatening violence, threats of self harm, threats of lies of abuse, and much more. All of which his father knew about even seen hidden video footage and still turned a blind eye. I figured having him just every other weekend would limit my younger two children to exposure and ensure that both myself and my husband were always around to make sure nothing else would happen. My son is very strong and has hurt me before to the point of my husband having to step in. At this point my husband is terrified for our other two children and himself. My son has made threats again of saying “he hurt me” or “he wants to kill me” along with threats of harming himself and others. He has also been refusing to take his ADHD medication. This is all he is on. The doctor refused to listen to me about my concerns due to his father stating “that doesn’t happen at my house” even though my son has expressed that his dad refuses to let him around his siblings at his dads house and his father says “I don’t want you”. I have explained to my son that I just want him to be happy and healthy but every day is a struggle. My husband is having a hard time which I completely understand. I can’t take my son to any other doctor without his father’s permission. I know more could be done and it’s not. 

My other two kids are doing amazing. Ever since I switched to having my oldest every other weekend my daughter went from being shy and tired to outgoing and loving. Even her teacher agreed. 

We recently discovered something wrong with our daughter. Her doctor recommended an MRI of her brain to see if there’s any damage from the trauma he caused when she was 3. My husband is talking about taking the other two kids and leaving during the time my oldest is here if that’s the case. It’s breaking my family more and more every day. I love my son to death I really do. But I’m also losing the family iv built. I’m not sure what to do at this point. 

And before someone puts two and two together. Yes I was 15 when I had my oldest. And his father was 20. In my state it was legal and nothing could be done about it. I was a dumb kid going through things no kid should and turned to the first person who would show me what I thought was “love”. 

EDIT TO EXPLAIN THE CONCUSSIONS: The first one was not seen. We noticed her acting off one morning and we thought she was sick. I took her to the doctor and they informed me that it seemed she had a concussion. My first thought wasn’t that my son had done something bad but I did install hidden cameras to make sure. Then the worse happened not longer after. My daughter didn’t even make a noise. I noticed activity on my phone as I woke up one morning. Sure enough they had been awake which isn’t abnormal but the fact that she hadn’t come to my room to say Goodmorning was odd. I watched back footage of my son throwing her. Dropping her. Laughing as she just laid there while sitting in the ER and being told once again she has a concussion. After that I called child services and told them to please help. Told them to step in. Fully expecting a visit that never came. Third time. Christmas Eve about 2 years ago. My entire in law family watched him shove my daughter into the fridge, moving the whole fridge (which is a giant double door fridge) and then watched my daughter fade in and out of consciousness. I informed my son’s father to come get his son and have been doing every other weekend since…

EDIT ABOUT FULL CUSTODY AND COURT: His father doesn’t even have him during his time. He drops him on his mother who is very much the type of “there could never be something THAT wrong with my family”. She’s more of an enabler. My son has explained that his father wants nothing to do with him and he just stays with his father’s mom. 

Also… despite it all I love my son very much and I want him in my life. I just want to help him. I don’t have the money really for court and his father… well his father’s family does.

I have stuff everywhere because I’m in the process of setting up organizing system and acquiring storage solutions which is another reason I don’t want to host this year. 

Today I swept and mopped, did dishes, deep cleaned the kitchen. Cleaned up the living room. Cleaned out the kitchen, brought in food to add to the pantry. Returned shelves that won’t fit because I found something else better. 

I just know I won’t even be able to talk to my family anyways because my child thinks they have to correct me and be a part of every conversation. 

Yes this is more of a regret up of husband post than of child but if I didn’t have a child with him maybe he wouldn’t be running my foreseeable future. 

He called me a bitch yesterday and a crazy person and said it was ok because he wanted an apology!? Then I sleep in the bathtub to get away from him and he sleep on the bed and I go and sleep in the couch. 

He has not even thawed the duck for Christmas, poured himself some alcohol and is talking to someone on the phone while  continue to deal with things inside! I am fuming! 

I told him if he can’t respect that I don’t want my family over I’m going to shut myself I. The room until when or if I feel social and the day of and day before I will not be helping him whatsoever.

Everyone had said to stop enabling. My husband I came up with a plan and it was to give her a deadline and an ultimatum either choose school, or work. I had said no more allowances either unless she helps around at least. Since she thinks she’s too good for a serving job, or a retail job, she had a meltdown when we suggested her to work. She of course said she wants to find a job in her field and our answer was “what field?” because she has not finished school so her options here are limited. Well, my husband and I left for work and when we came back, she was gone. But she had destroyed the house. Plates in the kitchen, shattered on the floor. TV, smashed in. Railings on the staircase, kicked in. Sofa, cut up. We called her she said “I don’t want to see your faces ever again” and we don’t know where she went.",Likely mother: 2 > 0

My daughter (5) told me recently she wants to be a mom when she grows up. She's told me several times after that she wants to have kids. I'm not surprised as I think she just has a very natural nurturing personality and I'm well aware this is normal within her age as well.

She's neurodivergent, her personal interest are animals and she always, since very very little, paired her toys as mother and baby. Sometimes she may add the father and rarely adds siblings. But mother and baby are her go to. She always melts with babies, this is natural in her. She has never seen me do that. She has even picked  a classmate she's going to marry to have kids with. I feel I have to carefully craft a plan to deter her from having kids, or at least redirect her nurturing inclination towards caring for animals and having baby animals instead. I prefer she be a veterinarian than a mother (which is a profession frowned upon where I live, so much so, there was a time students were PAID to study the career and I think only one university offers it)

I’m 3 months post partum and while I absolutely love my son I still feel like someone just died.
More specifically me, or a part of me. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Every waking minute I spend worrying and thinking about my son. But all I really want most of the time is to run away and be free of all the responsibility. I keep feeling like he’d be better off without a mom who feels this way. I keep wanting to just go through the day without planning his bottles, his diaper changes, his tummy time, hearing him scream, sleep training. I just want to be me again. 
The only thing I do lately that remotely feels like me is go for a run 2-3 times a week. I put my headphones in and blast really loud techno and just run anywhere. It makes me feel for a moment I could actually leave. I never do. But it’s become such an obsession that I overdo it. I almost go every day. I’m scared because last time I obsessed about something like this I got an eating disorder. 
I also can’t sleep at all, the only thought that puts me to sleep is ending it all. Like literally thinking about it until I fall asleep. The weird thing is I don’t even have any plan to do it at all or even want to. It just feels like I am getting through the days and they all feel the same.

I never wanted kids. I believed it was better to regret not having kids than to regret having them. I did not want to put a child through my dumb bullshit, and I also enjoy having personal freedom.

My daughter is now 5 months old and I am filled with regret. I feel horrible for her. I had my own housing situation with my husband since he's in the army and I had to move back in with my mom and my sister because I just couldn't fucking do it on my own as a SAHM. I have all this help when they're off from work. My mom WANTS me to be happy to be a mom. She accepts picking up my slack stoically and gracefully, all while working full time. My sister has fewer qualms about showing her contempt for me and it hurts me so bad, but I do not blame her. I was the one that laid down and made her, unemployed, manic, and knowing I was diagnosed with bipolar depression with probably a slew of comorbidities that haven't been named yet. My mom has never stopped believing in me it seems and it just makes me want to fucking weep knowing that all of her effort might end up being wasted.

The moment I found out I was pregnant I was ecstatic. I had always thought that if I ever got pregnant I would get an abortion without a second thought. That obviously did not happen. I could not go through with it. I cried while walking near the baby stuff at the store. I put it off until my sister forced me to tell our mother. Then I was keeping her. I had never been happier than during my pregnancy. Everyone was so supportive. My mom was always telling me cute and happy stories from raising her kids. My sister would cry tears of joy when we would talk about my baby. It felt like I had found purpose. This is where I will find fulfillment; in raising my child. I couldn't bear the thought of paying someone else to raise my child so we all agreed that I would be a stay at home mother and my mom and sister would function as a safety net for my husband and I, or just me if it turned out that way.

I believed in myself, that this is what I was made for. I believed in the bliss that I felt when I was pregnant. It makes it hurt even worse, because I truly, honestly thought I could do it.

I shouldn't have had a child, but this is my life and I've got to continue with it. I've shared a bit of the heartbreak on here, which helped, and I'm generally coping ok now. 

Recently I found out a family member is pregnant accidentally. This has made me really uneasy. My honest thought was, I hope they see sense and don't go ahead with it. I won't share their situation, but I will say I can think of a LOT of good reasons why having a kid is a bad idea for them and very few reasons to do it. That and my own experience made it a no brainer in my mind. I reached out and offered support thinking I could share my perspective if they wanted to hear it, in case they needed reassurance that termination was the right decision.

Turns out, though, that they plan to have the baby. Now I've got a family Christmas next week and all anyone is talking about is that so-and-so's expecting. Somehow I have to smile and go along with the idea that it's good news when inside I'm thinking ""OMG WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" 

I don't know what other option I have, though. It's her choice, right? She didn't want to talk when I offered. So I guess I just try and keep my thoughts to myself and find a way to be happy?

Sadly I don’t feel like my wife and I can give her the best life and the only reason being is we both really don’t like being parents and all the inconveniences that comes with it not having adequate help. 

Her mother and I met in college and rekindled after college and was pregnant within 2 weeks, never having gotten the chance to explore our relationship without the responsibility of a child. Fast forward 4 years and we are now 3 years married, tomorrow actually! 

I’m currently in therapy to try and get over my own childhood traumas but in that process I can’t help but notice I may be causing trauma to my daughter because I really don’t care for parenting, not to say I don’t play with her and show affection but it can be a huge struggle for me at times as it is the last thing I want to do or have capacity for. 

I think I may have undiagnosed adhd* getting tested soon. 

Continuing… is there anything that made you come around to enjoying parenthood having made the decision to not have any more and wanting to give the child you have a good life while also enjoying your own life in the process? I want to give her the best but i also don’t have that much to give more than I am. 

Little bit more context - I go to work 5 times a week as a financial analyst , 2 days at home - my wife works third shift th- sat as a nurse so I often am stuck doing the night routine and my weekends are consumed with no break, I don’t know how to entertain her for long periods I’ve tried doing sheets to get her ready for school, tried getting her to watch tv with me, tried giving her the iPad for a bit only to get bored with that eventually, she inevitably just ends up puppy guarding me all day and it gets really draining as I have never been a person who likes to be touched all day and I need silence after while I often just want to relax myself after the long week. Sorry I just need help it sucks for her to have parents who don’t like being parents I feel it will rob her of fun as we aren’t inclined to try new things with her as children can be a bit much in new environments. Today we take her to her first movie seeing Moana 2 but I can’t help but worry about how she’ll act and if she can handle it - but then again maybe it’s our fault for not exposing her to more things - which would require us to change our mindset which has gone back and fourth these 4 years but always resting in the unhappiness of parenting",Likely father: 4 > 1

My wife and I both work so the boy is in preschool and the girl is babysat by either by mom, her mom or us throughout the course of the week. 

I'm sure being around other kids is not helping, but my son is ALWAYS SICK. I truly believe he gets it worse than anyone I know. Since July of this year he has been coughing 60% of the time.

His pediatrician tells us he has asthma, so we do the nebulizer treatments but his coughing never seems to get better. At this point he probably had Covid, the Flu, RSV, pretty much evey kind of upper respiratory infection under the sun and he's currently been dealing with a cough for 2 weeks straight with no end in sight.

When his younger sister gets it, she gets over it in 3-5 days max, but he takes for-God damn-ever to get over everything and constantly waking me and my wife up every morning with his coughing fits.

It makes me feel like a dick that I get mad about this, because he can't help it and I genuinely feel bad for him being a revolving door of airborne diseases. But I have to tell you in hindsight had I known how perpetually sick he was going to be I would never have had kids.

It also sucks that when we have to pull him out of preschool for a day or two the school still charges you for the day. Shit is such a ripoff and my wife bitches about taking a PTO to stay home (I can't do that because I am a doctor myself and can't just drop what I'm doing to stay home and take care of a sick child, NOT THAT I WOULD WANT TO).

I stupidly gave him the wrong type of father. ( There should be a sub for that) It's such a long. long story.  

Basically my son exhibited anti social signs from probably 18 months, doing random things deliberately that annoyed other people, which further escalated a he grew older.  As a baby he was really unsettled too. But I adored him despite the exhaustion. 

I felt alienated and judged by other parents (and teachers)  of well behaved children. I had zero support just 'make him behave' constantly. He simply would not listen and seemed hell bent on bad behavior. Anything illegal he was drawn to it.

 I continually sent him to all types of courses & clubs, hopeful that something would help- anger management ( he resorted to being the clown and made the instructor & other kids angry) I switched him between so many day cares, primary schools and high schools hoping that would help, just maybe it was the schools fault and not his

He maybe had ADHD, but he was focused when necessary. I would say he had a learning disability though. Possibly Asperger's (was diagnosed) but more oppositional defiance disorder. He didn't really fit into a category for his benefit. 

By the age of 14 he was well known to the police. School would call and refuse to have him, which made working very difficult. I began self harming and developed a pot and alcohol issue. I had my suicide planned out. 

He punched me in the jaw and this led to me calling the police out and getting a hospital report then a violence restraining order. The thing that really bothered me is when he punched me, I sat on the floor for a moment gathering myself from the shock and was crying. He stood over me and said 'oh are you crying?'' in a mocking voice. In the police van he took photos of his new shoes I'd bought him that day and posted to FB. Later a large knife was found in his cupboard

He's now on his second jail time after two further domestic violence charges against separate girlfriends

I can happily travel alone leaving him with my husband, knowing that he is taken care or. Also I always think rather crave about a time when my kid will move out for higher studies.  I sometimes google the minimum age the kid can start boarding school and to be honest I would feel very relieved if my child wants to join boarding school. This is very different from how my mother operated. Her life revolved around mine and she became really sad when I moved out. So I am not able to validate this feeling as I have found nooone who relates to this feeling. I have a guilt of not having a mom guilt.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

16 December 2024,UPDATE : I feel like my aunt wants me to suffer as a single mother ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1hfp29v/update_i_feel_like_my_aunt_wants_me_to_suffer_as/,"So remember when lot of you here said I was an asshole, and I was upset my aunt wouldn’t let me use her, and I needed to suck it up or get a sitter ? Even after I explained that she goes as far as to get upset when I ask others to watch them ? Step forward, I’m ready for the apologies ….

Last night, my aunt called me and checked in. We had simple conversation and I let her know that I’d be spending Christmas at her house but on New Years, I’d be with my stepmom. My stepmom had been asking me for weeks if she could take my kids but she had just moved into her new apartment (she was staying with my dad). Apparently, my stepsister wanted me to go to a NYE party with her and told my stepmom first because *****I DONT HAVE A BABYSITTER*****. I didn’t mention the party but I did tell my aunt I’d be with my stepmom for new years. 

SHE BLEW UP. She must’ve said any and everything she could’ve conjured. Apparently, I’m still an asshole because “I’m choosing to take my kids to my stepmom instead of staying with my grieving grandmother”. This goes without saying that my grandma didn’t really care, and my stepmom just lost her life partner and her grandson and my stepsister just lost her son. Everybody is grieving. I asked her “******so you don’t ever wanna watch them and that’s totally your right to your time, but you’re upset when I find someone else to watch them?******” Pls bear in mind, I had no clue about this party and I kinda don’t even wanna go but why should I miss out on someone who they consider a grandmother wanting to spend time with them and is willing to take them ? As I said in my last post, she never wants to watch them, acts like she does, and then gets angry when I find someone else or someone else finds me. This is the exact same thing she’d do with my dad when he was living.",Unclear: 0 / 0

I’m not the best parent, but he is the best son. I regret having him to a scary man, being born in a family I don’t belong and in an unforgiving economic period of history. 

Just cleaned up the hugest mess. Didn’t carry on about it, just did it, took almost 3hrs, I think. 

All the time I’m thinking, if only I had a decent coparent, live in family member/s. I’d go for a walk. Or a little drive. It’s balmy, warm, not too humid. I’d sink into the ground level atmosphere and hide in that sensory rich world I’d love and despise at the same time for its aloneness. 

I recently was granted access to respite (I’m in my own with a special needs son), once a month is totally fine by me, won’t look a gift horse in the mouth, hoping to run through the night under the moon and just breathe just that little bit. I also have the proper coatings now and have the aim of expanding my business now solely to survive better and afford respite myself. 

I still have blackouts and panic attacks every now and again, but this situation I know will improve even more. 

One day, my son will prolly be in a supported living arrangement, or I’ll leave him this government house and set up his support workers or pay someone to check in weekly idk.

I have a relatively easy job in IT, and I’m grateful for it, but when the weekend comes, I feel miserable. I really don’t like the way my life is right now.

I have two boys, almost 3 and 4, and my wife is often angry. I used THC to cope for a while, but my wife strongly opposes it, so I quit to avoid conflict. While it keeps the peace, it’s been incredibly hard to manage without it.

I live with constant regret, and my wife feels the same. I catch myself daydreaming about a life without kids—or even being single. But there’s no escaping the reality that any decision we make would impact the kids.

Whether we stay together and continue to struggle, or decide to separate, they will suffer in some way.

However, it is almost as if giving me a break from them is something she won’t do. If I ask her to watch my children for a day or 2 so I can clean in peace, the entire time she has them she almost wants to know my every move. Even in a time where it’s clear I have no desire to be out and about in the mix of other people (my nephew/her great nephew and my father/her brother just passed away so I really don’t wanna be around other people too tough), she will twist and turn shit to make it seem like that’s what I’m doing. It’s as if she has made her mind up about my character and regardless to how crazy it sounds, if that’s what she thinks, that’s what she believes. 

The last time she watched my kids so I could clean, I was fresh out of a DV situation and my nephew and father’s passing was even fresher than it is now. The entire time she made it seem like it was a ploy for me to be out and about running the street. Bear in mind, I handled (and am still handling) all of my father’s final affairs so my grandmother doesn’t have to. So naturally, I really would like some time to myself to be able to clean AND relax. I don’t live at home (with her and my grandma) so she doesn’t have my kids often, when my kids are at her house, so am I and I’m doing things I would still do at my own home. But my home tasks and unwind time (according to her) are only allotted to when they are in school. I wanted to put them in after school but the applications went out the week my father passed. 

So one day, she let it slip that free time for me would require payment. Now, I do contribute to at least 75% or more of what goes in the fridge at my grandma/aunts house in addition to my own. I do any tasks that she doesn’t feel like doing or need help doing (grandmas laundry, footwork for bill paying, grocery shopping, things like that). I also live alone with just myself and my kids so those tasks are just for me. Her version of helping me with those things are coming to my home and doing them how SHE thinks they should be done while I would still have to deal with my children. When it comes to my house she says she’s never come over because “she’s gonna make it known what she doesn’t like and she’s never gonna give me the satisfaction of saying that she doesn’t have to be in my house if she doesn’t like it”. 

I am very tired all the time. I don’t get time to myself other than when my kids are in school and I still have so much to handle that I don’t relax. They give me absolutely no space and I’m a prisoner to their wants and needs. I’m unemployed so if I want time to myself, I’d have to take from something to give her what she wants to watch them and even if I do, it’ll still end in a barrage of calls, complaints, and text messages about either me not “communicating”, me trying to get away from my kids, me not wanting to be a mother, or how much more overwhelmed she is than I am because she aids my elderly grandmother (she’s not fully disabled, she’s just old. There are things she can do herself, she just needs more help than normal. Nothing like feeding, ambulatory help, or diaper changing). And then it ends in me saying fuck it and going to get my kids only to act like things were fine the whole time and she’s made a progress with them that I just don’t care to make. I really hate it here. 

*****EDIT TO ADD:***** I’m not sure if I said this, but she will ONLY watch them when I work but for no other reason. And when I work she HAS to have my schedule in full. She never asks me for it, she acquires it some other way. The last time, she was friends with my coworker and got it from them because “I wouldn’t be truthful if she asked me”

*****Second EDIT TO ADD:***** I do not feel she is obligated, I just think it’s a dick move to have people under the impression that you watch my kids all the time and then berate me as if I’m a bad mom when I actually ask. Like to make my distant family think I’m a street runner and my kids are with you soooooo much and then cause a scene when I ask for a day alone isn’t crazy ? And then to tell me I could’ve asked you to watch my kids cause you were free after the fact isn’t crazy to nobody but me ? She doesn’t have my kids out of my presence often at all, but she will make it seem that way for the sake of being seen as that involved family member.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

What no one warns you about is that you’ll be working from the time you wake until you go to sleep and unless you like cleaning up messes and doing household chores, all the enjoyment you have for life is gone for the foreseeable future.
I used to look forward to getting up in the morning because I had time throughout my day to enjoy but not anymore. Now everything is literally unenjoyable work. From going to the grocery store to traveling for the holidays, none of it is as enjoyable as it used to be and now doesn’t even remotely feel like it’s worth the effort.
And the schedule and planning for that schedule makes everything that much more difficult.
We have tried 5 times to make the train to go into the city early and have missed that early train each and every time. I never missed a train before I had a child to deal with.
And it just keeps getting better and better, now that she is a toddler, even giving her what she wants doesn’t stop the screaming when she is already upset.
I hate that I let myself get talked into this shitty place.
I hate all the sacrifices I already have had to make and the worst of all, I will continue to make them because I grew up in a divorced home around adults who never made these sacrifices for me. Instead I had to help raise myself and my brother. It never ends, all family does is ask, ask, ask, and became I’m able I should have to help. 
I wish I would have accepted the loneliness, instead I got the misery.

It’s so comforting to see some of the struggles I feel so guilty facing voiced from other people, and to see support from others regarding those taboo things. 
My wife and I went through fertility treatment, during this process she went from being the nicest person in the world and my best friend to being angry, spiteful, and mean. I understood completely, it was an extremely hard thing to watch (much less be apart of). 
I guess I thought it would stop… we have a 1 year old now, and she never really came back. The other night I asked her to please just stop being so mean to me… she said she’d “try”. I didn’t picture my life walking around on eggshells, scared to do anything because whatever I do gets me berated.
I love our child, who incidentally is the light of my life. She’s an amazing mother to him, and I like to think I’m a pretty good father. She’s just, revolted by me. We’ve had sex twice in the past year, which isn’t even the problem. The problem is she’s revolted by me. I touch her and she cringes, and I’m starting to feel the same way.
I just feel like we have this amazing kid in our life, but we sacrificed us to get them. She wants more, which when I say no, she claims I’m just being stubborn to be stubborn, and I seem to happy when I say no. I don’t know, I just didn’t see life going this way. I work full time, I’m in school part time (very limited so it’s not all consuming), and I do my best to come home and do everything I can.., she just hates me. I don’t think she’ll ever not hate me, and I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s so hard because I love my son beyond belief, but now my wife hates me, and when she’s home all day every day, it makes life pretty miserable.
Sorry about the long rant, just needed to get it out into the world I guess. No one in my personal life knows any of this, this just seems a very happy kid, an attentive mom and dad, and think everything’s perfect. It’s so far from perfect.

He missed the birth and when he visited a day after he was pissed off because he couldn't find our room. Of course he let it out on me. I cried. 

Then we got home, which I absolutely dreaded. He just quit smoking and was in a horrible mood, constantly screaming at me and even got violent. A few times I had to fear for my life. Luckily the child was never a target of this. Having to deal with that immediately after birth completely broke me and made bonding with the child so hard. 

Then one time he went too far and pushed me onto the ground while I was changing the babies diaper. He also took my phone away to prevent me from calling help. My mother knew something was off and called the police. Me and the child moved to my grandmother.

Fast forward to now he's nearly 5 and it's a shit show, he cries if I even raise my tone SLIGHTLY and thinks the world revolves around him. EVERYTHING and I mean everything is a problem, everything is a drama and I'm never 5 minutes away from
Another meltdown over nothing because he's turned into a brat. I have burnt myself out to the point I started hating him, hating my life and hating myself. Even when he was a newborn, despite being clinically diagnosed with ptsd from
His birth and having no support and being alone all day everyday I refused to even put on the tv or scroll on my phone because of the demonisation of screens. Yes you heard that right A NEW BORN. He wasn't even facing the screen he'd be breastfeeding and I'd just stare into the abyss on my own crying. Because I though that's what good moms do! 

Fairly sure I did more harm to both the kid and I trying to avoid any conflict and following completely unrealistic ig accounts that lived in fairy land. I even refused to take him to nursery because of how 'bad' it is and worked from home whilst looking after him at the same time and honestly I've just made myself so miserable. Point being, sometimes trying to be 'a perfect parent' backfires and actually turns you into a monster 

EDIT: I absolutely tried to be perfect because I love him so much, my parents were very abusive and then in turn made me terrified to ever put a foot wrong with my own child. I latched on to gentle parenting as I’d never witnessed what a good parent was. That on top of him being born literally as lockdown hit, I was in NICU alone whilst he fought for his life and then spent his first year alone with him in our house. My husband was a key worker and worked full time. When the baby was born his lung collapsed and he had pneumonia and because of that Covid isolation and the worry sent me quite literally insane. I have worked with psychologists and tried my best to get better. I tried so hard to be perfect it failed me.",Likely mother: 2 > 0

My own parents were total shit so I thought being conscious of it would make me a better and more self aware parent but 12 years later I realize broken people like me should never have kids because we only raise angry and needy people who never find anything to fill the profound hole we as parents leave.

I struggle with parenting because my kids don’t listen, get stroppy all the time and the only thing that ever works is yelling and screaming and threats and then they cry and complain I’m traumatizing them by yelling.

Yesterday we came home and the garage door wouldn’t open so the kids went home and instead of opening the garage door from inside, they just went to sit on the couch and watch TV, leaving me standing there in cold darkness, waiting for them to open the door. I called their cell phone 3x - “we didn’t hear it”.

They just didn’t care where I was.

I stood there for 7 minutes before one of them realized that they were supposed to do that.

This morning the older one made a scene in the car over a hairbrush and I just lost it. I called her names and said I wish they were dead because I was extremely angry and frustrated with them. 
The other started to cry and refused to leave the car so I was late for work by 20 minutes.

I have been feeling terrible since the morning and realized that we are a completely dysfunctional family where my husband and kids are extremely selfish and only see others as a source of meeting their needs. The older one wants me to pay for her expensive clothes and hobbies, the younger one wants me to buy her ice cream and toys.

I’m just an ATM to them. 

I try to do activities with them like sports and they say it’s boring doing it with me - they prefer to do that with their friends but not me.

My husband is generally selfish and controlling and stays with me only because I make more money than him. Everything has to be his way even if I’m not happy with the outcome. He installs stuff around the house (heating, garage opener…) that only HE knows how to operate, nobody else. 

He never supports me and expects me to figure out everything on my own then scolds me when I don’t. Doesn’t have my back at all.

I resent him and wish I could just divorce him and be happy. Too much money involved unfortunately.

I hate being married to him. I don’t like how my kids behave. I don’t like how my kids treat me. I never wanted any of this.

If I could pack my bags and move to Hawaii or Alaska I totally would but I can’t leave the kids with him as he’s not a great dad. Honestly worse parent than me and that’s something.

I wonder if my kids were better off in a boarding school or something because I just don’t have it in me anymore. I work full time, spend weekends driving around to their events/hobbies, basically spend my existence making sure everyone around me has a privileged lifestyle and everything they want except for me.

I feel like there are things that you don’t come back from and saying to your kids that you wish they were dead because you’ve just had it is one of them. There’s just no excuse. If something like that happens it is a symptom that tells you that something is deeply wrong and probably not fixable.

04 December 2024,I am becoming a monster,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1h6mz8m/i_am_becoming_a_monster/,"I can't go to work because I don't have money to pay a babysitter for the hours apart of school. There are no jobs compatible with school times.

Everyday from 2pm to 10.30pm I have to keep an eye on my kid (6M) because he loves doing anything except sitting down. Since I don't work, I can't afford to enrol him in any paid activities, and I really prefer to save gas instead of taking him to free activities which are too far away from where we live. So we ride the bike, go walking, go to parks... He runs, jumps, plays, non stop, I have never seen him seated.

Then at 10.30pm he finally goes to sleep (no, he won't sleep more, and then wakes up at 8am fresh and ready to start battling again) I am so sad about my life being just a police officer, watching that he doesn't hit himself or other people, that I dumb myself with some wine and surfing the internet or watching some film or whatever crap, nothing productive, because I don't feel productive, I feel like absolute crap.

I finally go to sleep at almost 2am, with my heart pumping hard in my chest with the anxiety that this won't get better. Don't say it will get better because these past 6 years it's been a nightmare (4 years of only sleeping 2 hours per day, I had hallucinations) and it only gets worse.

I can only visit my parents a little bit because they get headaches with how active my kid is.

My kid's father lives 3 hours away, I already told him he has to take his kid, otherwise I will kill myself.

Then, when I finally get to sleep at 2am, it's just 1 second and bum, it's 8am and kid is awake again, and I have to get him ready for school. Kid traspasses the school gate at 8.55h, I go home and get back in the bed because I am utterly exhausted and if I don't sleep a little bit more, I will be even more grumpy in the afternoon and evening.

I tried sleeping from 10pm to 8am, and it just makes me hate my life so much much much more.

I wish I could kill myself, but I won't do that to my kid. He doesn't deserve it. I promised myself I will wait one more year at least.

I must be paying some karma from past life, or this is the outcome of very poor decisions in the past.

I just tried to create a video to see if I could teach English (I am Spanish) online, but asynchronously, and even though I told my kid 5 times that mommy needed silence just for 5 min to record a video, he wouldn't stop playing, screaming... I am trying not to cry. Even the smallest attempt to improve my life, he wrecks them.

03 December 2024,Feeling hopeless unless I turn into a dictator,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1h5walb/feeling_hopeless_unless_i_turn_into_a_dictator/,"I'm actually a regretful stepfather. I'm struggling with a lot of suppressed resentment towards people who told me that family life is so wonderful and what a ""great guy"" I am for ""stepping up"". 



Wife is my age (40) and the kids (biologically hers) are 13F and 16F. I've been in the picture for about 4 years now. I know I'm ""not supposed"" to say this, but I probably wouldn't be making this post if it were just the oldest. She's generally a great kid who handles responsibilities well. She makes bad choices once in a while but usually understands why we have to discipline her for that and rarely makes the same mistake again.



The youngest is out of control (nasty attitude, cell phone addiction). I always start by asking her nicely to do something, but she never does it. I'll ask her five more times and get either ignored or told ""yeah I'm doing it now"" as she continues to stare at the cell phone. If I raise my voice and tell her to do it right now, she goes literally crying to Wife later, then Wife tells me that I hurt her feelings and made her feel bad about herself. Sometimes we sit down and have ""family talk"" times, and Youngest will usually agree when we tell her that this kind of behavior has to improve, but she'll be back to square one within a day or two. If I sit down with Wife and propose some rules (e.g. cell phone goes up at 8PM, nasty attitude is immediate grounding, etc.) she'll say that's a good idea and we're going to do it, but then get either forgetful or apathetic and just stop enforcing it after a few days. Sometimes I tell the kids to do something - for example to go to bed on a schoolnight - then they'll start the begging routine asking for just another hour, I'll tell them no, then Wife will contradict me right in front of them and say ""just half an hour"" or something. I think they've picked up that I'm just a really mean, overbearing jerk who exists to steal their joy. 



I'm seriously worried about her ability to become a functional adult, and it's an uphill battle because Wife either doesn't agree or lacks the motivation to impose consistent, compassionate discipline so that this behavior can improve (and yes, I try positive reinforcement as well, but she doesn't seem to care). 



I feel like there are only two options for me:

\- Just be the dictator over the whole house (tell Wife that this IS how we're doing things) and hopefully get Youngest to stop this behavior before she moves out. If she hates my guts, she'll hate my guts, but at least she'll be able to hack it in the real world.

\- Give up, let Wife do whatever she wants as far as discipline, wait out the \~5 years before Youngest moves out, and be at peace with myself knowing that I did all that was feasible to help her. 



I'm not really sure what's keeping me going except the knowledge that their own biological father is barely in their lives and is kind of a piece of garbage, and that in a few years they'll be out on their own. 



I catch myself daydreaming about the days when I was single and didn't have to worry about any of this. Honestly, the best times of my life these past few years have been when Wife and Youngest are out of the house. I miss not having to be the Gestapo and monitor what the kid is doing. I'm tired of yelling and tired of being the only one in the house who is making an effort.

I’m sure a lot of mothers genuinely feel like their baby completed their life. But for me at least, when I went through severe post partum depression, I started to make motherhood my entire identity. I mean ENTIRE.  Every post, every thing in my life.  Years later now that I’ve gained my own identity back I realize that was a trauma response to losing myself completely and just trying to grasp a sense of identity and purpose.  Now every time I see a woman’s entire account or identity revolving around motherhood and how it completes her.. I wonder. 

It now makes me sad when I see a woman’s entire Christmas list having to do with baby products, etc, with nothing actually for.      herself.  Every social media post of herself deleted and replaced by baby. Username changes from her own name to “(insert babies name)’s mommy”.   

Day by day I am trying to find my passions again, I had children when I was a very young kid and I became homeless and single.  It was a very very traumatizing time and my brain could not handle it, I couldn’t accept that my life now revolved solely around this child, and so I “embraced it” or so I thought. I was just giving into that trauma response.  
I then went through some type of identity crisis and started to go the complete opposite way, my inner teenage self came out and I went a little crazy, trying to hold on to any of what was left of my childhood before I destroyed it and ended it way too early.  I hated my children, resented them with everything in me even though this was not their fault. I still have many days where I do this and I’m trying to find a way to get past this.  No one else I’ve ever spoken to other than this subreddit have ever experienced these feelings.  I thought I was some horrible evil monster, but I was just a traumatized little girl.  Sure I fucked myself over, but I’ll never understand why other girls can have a baby and have a completely different experience than I did.  A huge village, everything they ever need. Not a second of stress.  Why did the odds not work out in my favor?  I’ve had many breakdowns over this and I resent a lot of my friends who have had an entirely wonderful stress free experience.

The CBD without THC didn't help at all. I know it's not the best way to cope, but I've been on anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants before, and never liked the way they made me feel. 

While the stressors are still there, I feel like the THC/CBD products are really helping me to stay calm enough throughout the day to handle things without having a mental breakdown.

How do you guys cope with everyday stress? Do you meditate (I never have even 5 min to do that)? Do you zone out in front of the TV? What is your thing?

- I didn’t realize that even when I’m away from them, I’ll feel like I’m on “borrowed time.” Not wanting to return, but feeling a sense of urgency to do so. 

- I never realized that if you want a tidy home, then every single day you’re going to spend a very significant portion of time cleaning and doing laundry and tidying. Over. And over. And over. And it still won’t feel clean.

- They can really sleep like shit. A single night of full-on no-wake sleep is NEVER guaranteed. 

- they will get sick and then get you sick at the least opportune times. It will be 100x worse than being sick on your own because you’ll have to function for them.

29 November 2024,My autistic son loves to make noise when people sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1h2c51h/my_autistic_son_loves_to_make_noise_when_people/,"My son 6M (Au/ADHD lvl 1) has like a switch that turns on the moment someone in the house is sleeping/napping or needs silence, he starts making noise, whether that's laughing out loud, talking to himself or talking to the video/toys he's watching/playing with. When he was younger (around 2 and half - 3 years old) he would literally start crying the moment his sister showed the littlest hint of being sleepy every fcking day. At this point nobody can convince me this is not on purpose!!! 'Cause there's no fcking way! It drives me nuts! No amount of explaining can make him understand!!! I envy the parents that as their kid grows older they can have some quiet time in the mornings. 

Every Saturday it's the same 💩. I wake up to get ready for work before anybody wakes up. He wakes up. I fix him something to eat and give him the tablet so he doesn't wake his dad and sister up as I leave, and what does he do? Starts laughing and talking out loud right when I'm leaving. During the day if everyone is awake and he has some time on the tablet, he watches it mostly in silence. But the moment his sister wants a nap, you guessed it... Noise noise noise.

His dad had a zoom meeting this evening. I don't know how many fcking times I had to ask him to lower his god-damned voice. I went to the kitchen and he came along, and started talking loudly knowing his dad was right there in the meeting.

I've read so many autistic adults talk about their inability to regulate their voice and how frustrated they felt as children because the adults in their lives didn't understand it was part of their medical condition. I don't know what to tell you Linda, wtf are we supposed to do then? Just shrug and be like ""oh well, it's their autism"" and just endure it??????????

What's worse is his dad tells me he usually doesn't bother him in the mornings when I'm not there. I know it's because his dad doesn't do anything with him. On the contrary, If my husband is not in the house in the morning, my son has come, sometimes quietly (others barging in full volume) and tell me that he wants me and his sister to wake up because he doesn't want to be alone. My heart breaks... I know he doesn't want to be alone, but ffs you don't need to wake your sister up for that! Do you really need everybody's attention?????!!!!!",Likely mother: 6 > 1

28 November 2024,I kinda hate myself for this,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1h1mt5t/i_kinda_hate_myself_for_this/,"God damn guys. Just venting. 

I'm SO CONFUSED. 

I honestly hate being a parent to my oldest daughter. She is batshit crazy, 5 years old and just plain wild. She's medicated as much as we can but she's just insane. Screaming, yelling, making baby noises, flashing her privates to everyone, extremely ODD and PDA and has autism and ADHD. This has been the longest 5 years of my life. She used to mask around the grandparents but now she even beats them up and is horribly rude. 

She artistic and can be so sweet. She's smart and picks up on things so fast. I know she can be awesome, I've seen it. But lately I just.....am absolutely losing it. 

She's saying things that she knows are my deepest hurts. She finds things to pick at me about that are beyond normal. Makes fun of me for not having my license and mocks me to ""have someone come pick me up"". Or she mocks me or uses my aunt who just passed away to hurt me. Makes fun of me for missing her OR brings her up intentionally when I'm already very sad. She lies constantly and tells people I hit her when I ABSOLUTELY would never lay a hand on my child or abuse them..I'm afraid she's going to get me in trouble so I secretly film a lot of our day as a buffer. 

I am SO calm and redirect and ""punish"" as much as I can keep up with, but like seriously, cleaning up her crushing an entire bag of pretzels on the floor while she escaped time out and completely obliterated her little sister, I cannot keep up! There is only one of me! I try the parenting classes and ADHD dude but she's out to get me, I swear! She told me the other day she'll be good and not do these things for her dad because she actually loves him. But I'm literally the primary parent and I give this kid EVERYTHING. 

Thing is....her little sister is an absolute fucking ANGEL. Like the best human being I have literally ever encountered. Everyone I meet says she has an aura about her that is beautiful, and it's TRUE. literally everyone leaves saying their faces hurt because they smile so much being around her. I feel the same way. I absolutely adore my youngest child, she is calm, and kind and caring and so sweet and smart. And she gets non stop bullied, hurt, screamed at, and belittled by her sister. I feel so so so bad for her.


All this being said I treat my children INCREDIBLY equally. If anything, my oldest gets more and more patience because of her need for more attention/help with life tasks. She's in therapy and OT. On meds. In school with an IEP. I'm just like so mom guilty over one of my children being a complete and utter ray of sunshine (like guys I'm not kidding she's the happiest human I've ever met) vs having the most difficult and stubborn and miserable other child. 

I will never treat them differently or compare them. I will never make my oldest daughter aware or make her feel bad. Even my body language I pay SO close attention to so my eldest will hopefully never know, but it's so hard for me. And I'm so exhausted. Im falling deeper and deeper out of love or something weird? I just want a normal and calm life and I was like halfway there and idk what I'm even saying here, I am just sad. That's it. Thanks for listening.",Likely mother: 2 > 0
27 November 2024,Parenthood has broken me,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1h149lm/parenthood_has_broken_me/,"We wanted this. We chose this. My daughter recently turned two and it has been the hardest two years of my fucking life. 

Newborn phase was bad, but I thought it was for everyone so whatever right? She always struggled with feeding. She was a reflux baby and the vomit was CONSTANT. She’s a tiny kid so we were (and still are) stressed out about her growth. I figured she’d outgrow this but she didn’t. At 6 months we thought solids would help but she’d just gag and choke on even the softest purées. Queue the never ending stream of doctors appointments. 

With all the vomiting our doctors figured it was a GI issue. An endoscopy found signs of mild reflux but otherwise no issues. Did swallow studies and other imagining and all come back normal. This just cycles on for almost another year. More to come on the medical side.

Daughter turns one and she’s missing milestones. We get her into early intervention for speech, feeding, motor and cognitive. Seeing even more specialists to basically test what seems like everything (vision, hearing, neuro etc). 

Over all of this time we are living in anguish. Wondering what the fuck we did wrong. Why is our little girl struggling so much. Do we just have a kid that throws up for no reason? We feel like we’re doing everything and getting nowhere.

Her motor development catches up by 14 months. Feeding starts to get easier by about 16 months but still throws up almost daily. At 18 months all of this starts to come to a head.

She goes to the ER with a UTI. A follow up ultrasound shows she has kidney stones. We are clambering to get her in to see a specialist but “it’s not an emergency”. Welp she gets another UTI and they do another ultrasound and it’s way fucking worse than expected. She gets an emergency nephrostomy which is a fancy way of saying that had to put tubes through her back to drain her kidneys into bags. 3 days in the hospital with tubes sticking out of her AND THEY SEND HER HOME. Some shit about how she’s stable and they’ll schedule follow up surgery. 

We can barely manage at home. She’s constantly screaming, pulling at her tubes, won’t eat. The second day home she clocks in a whopping fever so back to the ER we go. UTI spread to her blood stream. 

I raise holy fucking hell at the hospital to get them to attempt a stone removal surgery. It fails. One of her kidneys is so packed full of stones that they can’t get the instrument through to break them up. She had a seizure in my arms at the ER, something I have nightmares of to this day. 

We then proceed to wait 3 FUCKING MONTHS for the follow up surgery. They at least placed stents in her ureters so they could remove the bags. But my god 3 months of an in pain toddler who can’t speak and communicate her needs. 

Now during all of this time we’re like HOW THE FUCK DOES AN 18 MONTH OLD HAVE SO MANY STONES. Well we qualified for rapid full genome sequencing. Turns out she has a genetic condition that causes her body to not break down a certain amino acid which causes stones. BUT WAIT - THERES MORE. She ALSO has an extremely rare genetic mutation that is associated with developmental delays and intellectual disability. It is so rare that only a few hundred cases in the whole world are known. It is unknown as to what kind of life my daughter will have. These two genetic issues are independent. Having both together is literally 1/350,000,000. You are more likely to win the Mega Millions than have both of these. She won the shit lottery. 

She got the surgery done finally and honestly it went very well. A week after the procedure she got her last tube out and since then she has been a completely different kid. She actually eats. She only throws up when she’s sick. Her cognitive development exploded. She is still speech delayed but just had her first word verbally and knows three others through sign language. She re started daycare and is adapting well. 

Despite this, I am having a hard time moving forward. I am broken. My therapist says I have PTSD. I can’t sleep at night sometimes because I have nightmares about the whole thing. I constantly think about when she seized in my arms in the ER. I hear noises when they aren’t there. Like I’ll be trying to relax to try to sleep and I’ll hear cries. Sometimes they are real, but sometimes they are not. When I do sleep I have nightmares about my daughter - sometimes based on events but sometimes fictional shit like not being able to find her at home. I feel like I am going insane. I’m typing this right now because my daughter woke up screaming for no reason at 2:30am and now I can’t get back to sleep because every time I close my eyes I just hear crying. I fucking hate this. I hate my life. I feel intense guilt because my daughter chose none of this but I feel a lot of resentment and then guilt because of my resentment. I’ve had 6 hours of sleep in 2 days. I wish I’d have an aneurysm so that the pain would just go away. 

Edit: I should mention that I’m a father as some initial comments seem to assume that I’m a mother, though it goes without saying that my wife has been greatly affected by this as well.",Likely father: 2 > 1

26 November 2024,I understand why people get divorced after kids ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1h0n1uu/i_understand_why_people_get_divorced_after_kids/,"I just need a place to vent. I have a partner who is mostly a SAHD. I hate that he is a SAHD, because of moments like this that seem to be increasing in frequency. 
We're visiting family for Thanksgiving and I work full time from home. My partner works part time, he barely gets 10hrs a week in it's mostly so he doesn't lose his path back to full time work later on. He told me he had a meeting during naptime and if I could sit with our 1yr who usually has to have a contact nap the first day at a new place like today. I don't mind the snuggles. 
What I do mind is having my entire workday interrupted because I agree to cover what was supposed to be a 30min time window. I have been nap trapped for 2 fucking hours!
He explicitly chose to be a SAHD. We didn't need either of us to stop working to have our kid in daycare and we even worked through an agreement on division of labor and responsibilities, including what to do when we are traveling/visiting family. This is literally all because he was unhappy working and wanted time with our kid. He loves being a dad. 
Somehow I always end up doing a portion of childcare during the day a few times a week when I am supposed to be working. Mid nap just now, kid wakes up calling for Dada and I call him being like, where are you, we were supposed to switch almost an hour ago? And he says, I'm in a work call. I hung up because I was furious that I am in this position yet again. I feel like when I am on kid duty I am completely alone, no matter how overwhelmed I get, and God forbid I make a decision without consulting him first. I have been so unhappy with my life since my terrible pregnancy and truly think it's be happier completely alone. These situations keep shoving me towards this conclusion. 
I am starting to resent him, and he also keeps claiming that I said I would ""be done working for the day"" when I'm not so he has an excuse to do whatever he wants that he can't do with a toddler around, as if me working this morning magically produced 8hrs of work. This is becoming a regular thing and i am so fucking angry. I now have to work even later to put my hours in that this nap has eaten up instead of spending it doing something mildly enjoyable. 
I'm tempted to start going into the office daily just to not end up in this position to then get blamed for it when my partner is the one (IMO) ignoring his responsibility that he begged for. 
I even told him this morning that I didn't want to work from my in-laws house because I get too distracted. I didn't want to tell him the truth which is, he is doing a shitty job at keeping our kid busy so he doesn't come and distract me. 
He asked me if I could work from my in-laws so he could take this 1 call during nap time and I thought it would seem unreasonable if I said no to this request. He even stated that he would switch with me as soon as he was done. I honestly didn't want to get into it this morning, but look where I am! I was fucking right and I don't even know how to address this with him. I've tried and failed, and have had days where I would ask for him to be out of the house part of the day so I wouldn't have a toddler knocking on my door during an important call. 
I don't know if he doesn't think it's disruptive or he doesn't pay attention or he doesn't care. 


UPDATE:  Thank you all for the support! I really needed to vent in the moment and I appreciate all the responses.

 Husband realized he fucked up, made up for it, and we had a discussion about how this has been happening more and more. He agrees that he needs discipline in the responsibilities we agreed to at the start of his SAHD or revise the agreement we wrote up. I will admit it is very hard for me to say no to our son, because the crying drives me insane and he is velcroed to me so I will do almost anything, including derail my workday to keep him from crying if i can. In classic relationship communication problems (lol): husband assumed that if I was responding to our son trying to come into my office, that I was ok with them being in my office in the past. We do try to be more direct and I recognize that I wasn't doing that even when he asked, ""is it ok if we're in here."" And if say ""fine"" when it wasn't. So clearly I added to this situation and take accountability for it. 
He also agreed it would help us both if I went into the office a couple of times a week. 
We're not getting divorced, and because I regret having a kid (no matter how much I love him), anything that goes mildly wrong makes my brain immediately jump to it as a solution.
Kids are hard and we had such a strong marriage prior, so it's been hard to reconnect with a third person in our life that we both prioritize. I thought we were rock solid so it makes me sad how much we've drifted since having a kid, adding to the regret.",Likely father: 1 > 0

Husband (24M) and I have been together since 15 married at 18.

My childhood was not great, from not knowing my dad, to having abusive step dads for most my childhood, going though things I knew were wrong but feeling scared and trapped to helping my mum raise 4 kids at 16 (mostly me and my husband did it all) while working and trying to go to school. she was also very narcissistic and has Bi polor. She would get mad and leave nights in a row. I paid for rent and bills worked in childcare to be with the kids, drove without a licence to get us around. My husband helped when he could but didn't live with me and his dad didn't like him around my mum.

Not great, but I planned my first pregnancy to get away from the life I was living at 16 had my daughter at 17. I know it's wrong now but my past was horrific and having a baby did save me. I see professionals due to my past truma too.

I am a SAHM and hate it. My husband is a fulltime apprentice on miminum wage. This Is his second apprenticeship as the first one he didn't enjoy, so we have lived like this for a long time.

I don't eat much, lost alot of weight, hate my mum body. I still exercise mostly weight train. I take vitamins. I'm on zoloft. I don't go out much because its hard with kids and my confidence is though the floor. I always struggle to feel good and normally give up on the idea. My husband tells me I'm stunning and has given up porn because he thinks Im enough.

since my 4th was 6 weeks old I have had 4 car accidents due to living in auto pilot mode. And I'm always needing to put the baby down and lock myself in another room To calm down or breathe.

I never got to have my own life and missed out on teen years, I have regrets getting married young and having kids early but at the time we had my siblings almost fulltime for a year and it made sense to have our own so I thought...

I am trying to get though all the past and give my kids better seeing a parenting couch, attending mums groups and seeing professionals but...

Now my husband has freedom and im stuck again. I am so hurt watching my husband get live his life now, his sacrificed his time and health in ways and supports me but I am angry I sacrificed my ability to get a job, my body, my mental state, my health and all my time to have our kids. I get angry that he is told things by other males even tho he is amazing and doesn't act opon it. I'm upset that his calmer with the kids then I am. I am upset he gets invited out while I've never been out with friends without a kid attached to me. I'm upset he Still gets to live with minimal resrestrictions compared to me, like leaving the house without dragging kids with him, without organising kids before agreeing to do things. I hate that even getting married I had to take his name and our kids just get his name by defult.

I hate how even pregnant my world changed and his didn't. All he had to do was show up to the birth. He still drank, had his body to himself and went out. I don't like drinking but it still upset me that I couldn't do that or go out. 

I love my kids and my husband. I just want to be happy, not touched all day, one day maybe have me time (not appointments or mum groups) and finding meaning for myself not just be mum and experience life (things I like).

I'd worked there long before having kids so when my first came along it was no trouble to go part time and fit around the kids while still earning a decent amount. I could even duck out whenever necessary to do things at school and I could work at home almost all the time. Now I have no job and no hope of finding one in my field with those hours and flexibility. My comfortable salary will be gone. Work at home gone. Career gone. Colleagues who are also leaving at the same time will walk into another job because they are able to work full time and I'm not. Just another reason to regret my stupid life choices. I try not to look at my innocent kids with such resentment, it's not their fault after all. But they fact remains I would still have a career if I hadn't had them.",Unclear: 0 / 0
22 November 2024,When the school confirms your spouse sucks at parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gxbnot/when_the_school_confirms_your_spouse_sucks_at/,"Today I had a meeting with the coordinator and my son's teacher to discuss his behavior at school. Right off the bat both of them asked me to take matters into my hands and leave my husband out of it because whenever they inform the dad about the behavior our son is exhibiting at school, he laughs/smiles in front of the kid. They usually use me to threaten the kid (you know, the good ol' we're calling your mother if your behavior doesn't improve) and he usually settles because I don't play around and set consecuences in place without mercy. My husband on the other hand likes to play the fun parent and avoids confrontations.

It infuriates me, because this is the man that wanted the goddam kids!!! Doesn't like to parent and then blalantly blames our kids misheaviors ON ME! He has literally said ""I don't mind the kids, it's the way they're being raised"" or ""the way YOU are raising them"". With the school making me responsible it is clear that it's not me, he's a big chunk of the issue when it comes to our kids behavior.

I'm so done, and they're not teens yet. I can picture him giving them what they want and villainizing me. I really need an out of this marriage",Likely mother: 3 > 0

22 November 2024,Regretful parent with even more regretful spouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gx101r/regretful_parent_with_even_more_regretful_spouse/,"I'm very happy to have found this sub when I needed it. I’ve been married for 6 years and have 2 boys, 4 and 1.5 years old, and a dog. 

My marriage is bad, I do not love my wife. We barely have anything in common. We don’t eat the same food, like the same movies, have the same curiosities or have the same hobbies. She doesn't have hobbies actually. The main commonality is morals, certainly important but not enough. She doesn’t have any ambitions and I have many. We have to compromise on everything, and it’s exhausting. We don’t talk constructively, everything turns into an argument, and she’s very passive aggressive with me. She does have good qualities as a person just not as a partner (for me at least). I plan to propose separation in January. 

I have to imagine she feels similar. I don't hide my unhappiness. But she thinks it's more about general depression and that I need meds. So giving antidepressants a try. She's been pressuring me to have a 3rd kid for over a year. She wants to try for a girl. I’ve repeatedly said “no, I can’t do it.” Definitely can’t do it with her. 

Now to parenting. I fell into the trap, “Settle down, start a family, it’ll make you happy.” But pretty much every trait I have goes against what a parent should have. I get frustrated easily, I value my time, energy, independence, freedom, focus, and creativity greatly. I need control and order. I'm particular. I cannot stomach parenting alongside someone I do not love. 

I like kids, I’m good at making them laugh and playing games so I thought I was a dad type person, but turns out I’m the “fun uncle” type, the sprinter not marathoner. I feel like parents have a so-called “tolerance tank” and when their kid drains it, they do something cute, or hit a milestone, or they get a long break and their tank fills back up. That doesn’t happen with me. I don’t feel that. I always feel depleted.

To complicate things further, I absolutely love my dog. The thought of her missing me breaks my heart. She always sleeps on my side of the bed, waits for me to get out of bed if I sleep in, stays up with me if I stay up late, and lays next to my desk if I jump on the computer. 

Several years ago I had a successful business that was acquired. Made good money from it but not enough to be financially independent. I yearn to get back to building, solving problems alongside smart people, and achieve financial independence. I aspire to give back and be philanthropic, I want to be a professor later in life and help cultivate minds. 

I thought I could hang onto that with a family but a bad marriage and young kids depress me and drain every ounce of my energy, ambition, motivation, creativity and passion or whatever’s left of it. But I’m still in love with accomplishment. It's just been distant. 

I feel like the reality of what I want is to eventually divorce, the question is about custody. I don’t know what I can handle. Maybe I can handle 60/40 if I’m happier being divorced? That’s a hard decision. And I have no solution for my dog other than maybe to visit. 

I appreciate your kids words and perspectives in advance.",Likely father: 3 > 0

21 November 2024,I hate myself for having kids.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gw93al/i_hate_myself_for_having_kids/,"I constantly ask myself, ""Why did I do this to myself? Why did I have kids?""

To make a long story short, I had a son 8 years ago; I left his daddy before he turned a year old because he was such a helpful partner, not a good husband. He barely paid attention to our son and couldn't do it anymore. I was a single mom for 5 years, and it was tough, but I started the hang of it; I finally had a babysitter that I trusted and was finding myself again! Till I met my now husband. I wasn't looking for anything serious, but he was; I tried breaking it off a couple of times but failed because he would get emotional, and I couldn't handle it. I got pregnant not long after and wanted to get an abortion, but he said we would be OK to keep it, and I foolishly agreed, even though I knew the majority of the responsibility would fall on me.

Three years have passed, and I am struggling so badly that words can not describe it. I became a SAHM and moved; I have no friends, hobbies, individuality, or time for myself. I am isolated and alone. My husband works, and sometimes he is gone for months, and I am stuck with the kids. Even when he is home, he still has his job, hobbies, and social life, while I have nothing. Right now, he's been gone for two months, goes out every weekend and every chance he gets and I AM STUCK!!!! I can't even shower without the kids following me around. I am trying so hard to not be jealous or envious of him but most of the time i just HATE myself. I hate that I committed to this even though I knew what would happen, I hate that I had another kid, I hate that I have kids period but above all I hate myself for feeling the way I feel. I want to enjoy my kids, I want to be grateful and thankful I have them but even though I love my kids and I try to be the best parent I can be, I am just so exhausted and tired of it.

I'm not the best parent. I'm not even a good one. In fact, I'm pretty bad. I've developed a temper and they are incredibly hard to handle, so it comes out a lot. But that means that I have all of these ""opportunities to repair"" with them.

But the idea of doing that makes me so uncomfortable. Just in general, I'd really rather keep them at arm's length. In general, the thought of having any sort of ""heartfelt"" moments with them makes me cringe, honestly. When I see other people being playful and goofy and sweet and all that with their kids, I don't know how they can do it. 

I'm just not built to be a parent, in general, but in particular I have no emotional capacity for children. I feel like I can have maybe one deep, true relationship in my life at a time, certainly not three or four and not when they all live with me and I have to spend all my time with them.

I understand that it might not be as easy as answering these questions to solve someones issues. And there might be people here that don't want/can/feel like answering those questions. 

Just know: Moms are the backbone of society, we shape the future of our nation. Our society has devalued motherhood to a point where even we as mothers might question our value. But be sure of one thing: you are valuable!

18 November 2024,Biggest mistake of my life?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gtwrsg/biggest_mistake_of_my_life/,"Ps long post! 

I wanna go back and redo my 2023/24. I just want a redo. I wish i never met her father i wish i never ever got pregnant i wish i had gotten the abortion i hate my life
I (23f) don’t even know where to begin! Last year i met this guy (22) he was very cool and trusting we had sex w condoms of course and then for my birthday we had drunk sex with the pink pussycat  and i had no knowledge what so ever that he orgasmed in me and he never told me so i kept waiting for a period that was never coming. I finally took a test and it said the dreaded pregnant. I never slipped up like this before so i just cried seeing that seeing the pregnant on the test was killing me. 

i told my mother and she asked me what did i want to do and i said i didn’t know and she asked if i told him yet i said no i was goin to tell him later that night. I told him and he ofc was just as shocked as me did say he would support my decision every step of the way and he did he came to the drs appts, fed me, rubbed my belly, my feet and all. when i was about 18 weeks i randomly did not hear from him. 

i ofc was worried so i was texting him and trying to figure out what was goin on heard nothing. He called me maybe 3ish weeks later (he had to get his family members to try and find my socials) because he was arrested. I was genuinely shocked and confused on what even happened he sort of explained as much as he could on jail phones. 

So that all happened he was in jail waiting for a court date and judgement the rest of my pregnancy and the entire 7 months once she was born. The entire time i’m think he’s still yanno gonna be involved. 

he finally gets his court date and they gave him 7 years. he calls me and says babygirl is not his and all this other bullshit. so as any other normal person would be i was confused asf because i broke my celibacy for him so he was the only person i had sex w in 2023 so hearing that just idk really hurt me bad. during the pregnancy he helped me pick names, was excited to finally have a march baby (his other daughter birthday is coming up) and all! 

he did call me like 2 weeks later to apologize about it but i told him that an apology is not going to fix it. if you are so unsure the only thing we can do is either have ur mother fly up and get a dna or we can take one once u come home he said okay cool. we have not spoken since that conversation 

I recently found out that hes out. And he did he came past my house knocked on the door i didn’t answer because i was getting ready for work (i live w my brother) and assumed he would’ve opened the door. so i only saw him getting in the car and pulling off. Since then i have been blocked on everything from him and his sister. His mother and i is still friends. 

He did come past and knock again however i was sleep so i only heard the knocks but by the time i looked out the upstairs window i seen his car pulling off. Now yes i do acknowledge that i should’ve been more proactive at getting the door but he could’ve called or texted that he was coming instead of just popping up. However 3 knocks on the door and just leaving is also crazy. 

My friends and mother says i should go to his house since he came to my house twice but i’ve texted him and gotten no response. I’m personally convinced he do not want to be apart of her life and everybody says im wrong for having that conclusion however i do not know what else i can do yea he might’ve gotten a new number but if his sister blocked my phone number and sm and he completely blocked my sm do that not say he do not want to be in her life? 

i’m so confused yet also feel soooo stupid. i feel like i made the worse mistake of my life getting pregnant and keeping it. it could simply be my feelings being hurt about him saying he’s not her father and he was active before getting arrested.  


any advice please! and please be kind i’m still having lots of depression and anxiety as a postpartum mother

I’m a mom and I wish I could be like a weekend dad. I have about a 65/35 split with my ex (I’m a stay at home mom and watch my two young kids while he’s at work), and every moment alone I feel guilty. I’m not working so I feel guilty. I’m not cleaning so I feel guilty. I’m not doing something productive so I feel guilty. There’s so much to do and at what point can I just enjoy or build my life?

I’m exhausted all the time and I wish I could just work and come home and relax all day. I was pressured into having kids so I put a lot of the pressure back onto their dad and my mom to watch them, but I still am exhausted because I watch them most of the time, am still carrying 100% of the mental load, and have most of the household chores on my shoulders as well as needing to work and make money myself. I hate this life. 

A small part of me wants to let their dad have custody, but he’s like a zombie when he watches them, he’s a miserable person. My oldest has a personality like mine, he’s independent, thoughtful, can be reserved, I’m scared if I leave him no one will have real, one on one interactions with him. And of course I just can’t leave them. I don’t want to but the pressure is so much.

Growing up my mom always talked about how her 20s and college time was the best time of her life, that she was in college 7 years, she had fun with her friends, drank, partied, whatever.. built up a good career for herself that she still has today even after my dad abused and left her, and didn’t have kids until she was 33 with a home and stability.

That’s the same woman who told me while I was in college at 23, no stability, no where to live, that 23 “was already old” for having kids when I was thinking about getting an abortion and told her I felt I was too young.

Fuck my mom. The same person who took away my childhood being with my abusive dad, same one who took away my early 20s because I was lost and didn’t have her because she was too busy with my dad, and I spent all my time worried she was going to be beat or choked to death (and she let me know it’s almost happened many times!)

My kids dad was 27 at the time, he had already gotten to go to college, start his career, go travel, party with his friends, have fun constantly, and didn’t care one bit what I wanted. He threatened to burn down Planned Parenthood if I went and got an abortion.

And now here they both are. MISERABLE. I’m literally the only one who fucking smiles at the kids and plays with them. My mom hates watching them, she doesn’t say it but it’s like pulling teeth getting her to help even though she promised when I was pregnant to watch them all the time so I could work so I wouldn’t have an abortion. She rather play on her phone and gamble 24/7. My ex is so stressed all the time that he never smiles, never plays with them, just sits and puts the tv on Miss Rachel for them and does whatever. He’s in a ridiculous amount of debt as well basically gambling (stock market) so great for them.

Why did they even pressure me to have kids if this was the life?? But they don’t mind, because most of the damage and pressure is still on me. They still get to have their separate lives and have their careers and all that great stuff. Fuck both of them.

We were both on the fence about having kids, but I was definitely leaning towards the not having them side. The Dr. told my wife it would take a year for her body to regulate hormones after going off birth control. Her idea was to go off and see how we felt each month when her period came. If it was relief, we would have a pretty solid idea how we feel. We never got the chance. Unprotected sex 1 time and she was pregnant. 

I really struggled with just 1, but my wife loved our first around 1. She really was the easiest baby in the world. Even though I said I didn’t want a second, we still ended up pregnant again at her pressuring. I don’t blame her for this. I should have been better at standing my ground. 

Well now I can say that having 1 kid is a joke compared to 2. The second is the classic second child that is crazy and a shit disturber. They are both fine on their own, but as soon as they are together it is just awful. I genuinely hate evenings and weekends. I am so jealous of others who have none or their kids have moved out. I love the girls, but I hate being a parent.

They are just so illogical, stupid, stubborn, whiny, and needy. I can’t stand it. You try to do all these things for them to give them a good childhood and it’s just met with entitlement and screaming. 

The hardest part is that it feels like it will just never end. Like 15 years until the youngest is old enough to move out. So yes, it will end eventually, but that is a very long time to just be miserable and grinding through life. 

Sometimes I dream about how much happier I would be to just live by myself. There is no doubt that if I could go back I would tell myself don’t do it. I have very little patience with them and sometimes wonder if they would be better off without me.",Likely father: 4 > 1

-demanding only specific people to see a newborn 
-going to a bar and socialising at any given opportunity as soon as baby born, leaving spouse to manage baby alone.
-finding post-pregnancy emotions ""exhausting"" and commenting on it
-asking your own parents for advice when spouse didn't ask
- returning to work and demanding family home is spotless when returning from work.
- expecting spouse to manage all baby needs overnight
-being unsure of how to respond when spouse says that she won't stop you from socialising and carrying on your life as normal as she's not ""your mom"".
- not begging spouse to stay home as a first priority with new baby and looking for any excuse to be outside the home while the other parent stays home.

I understand adapting to parenthood is hard, I carried our baby and feel quite resentful of my spouse wanting to socialise so much on days off and not ""choosing"" to stay home.

I have lots of empathy that it can be difficult for a spouse to adjust, however I'm despondent to ask for help and am repeatedly saying I won't stop my spouse from the choices that he makes, he asks ""permission"" to socialise and since our baby was born I've informed that it's his choice and he doesn't need to ""ask permission"". Time and time again he chooses anything other than staying home with me and baby.

I said that his actions show me who he is and where his priorities lie it feels as though he wants me to get angry, upset or mad but I'm just numb to all of it.

How betrayed so many of us have felt at that sentence when things just got worse and not better?

Sure my daughter sleeps through the night and doesn't scream bloody murder for 8 hours straight every single day, but she cries for fking everything still and she's in therapy 'cause it was clear this shit behavior was not going anywhere. Meltdowns before school, meltdowns over food, meltdowns to pick up the toys, meltdowns over the clothing. I felt like she was crying 3/4 of the day over stupid shit and that 8 hours of crying at night was better than that! I've told my husband we're gonna be dealing with an adult crying for everything as well and he doesn't believe me. That I'm just being pessimistic and people can change. My guy. The girl is a ball of tears since the day she was born and hasn't stopped in 5 fking years. It's clear this is a core part of her personality,  that cannot and will not change. Maybe therapy can help her regulate better, at least I've seen a drastic change in the meltdowns. but I'm dreading the teenage years. You cannot tell me it's going to be better once they're teens either. It may only get better after they are gone of the house, and some parents won't even have that luxury.   
  
I've been burnt out for almost 7 years. Kids are more independent but I'm not okay at all, my mental health just gets progressively worse and worse and worse. From the outside people see my kids thriving and may not think anything of it, but goddam I feel I sleep worse now than when they were babies!!!!!

I prefer the phrase ""it gets different"". It's more realistic and neutral. ""Better"" has many factors that can sabotage it, but it will always evolve into something different. That can be better or not.

The expectation of change is better than gaslighting myself into thinking it'll be better and then get this soul crushing reality that it won't.",Likely mother: 1 > 0

16 November 2024,What makes us so different..?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gsun9i/what_makes_us_so_different/,"I hate parenthood. I regret it so much. I don’t think I have enough right into what parenthood entailed, but I can’t help but wonder, what makes us so different? I’ve heard people say that they didn’t want a child but got pregnant and it changed their life for the better, the don’t know what they would do without their child, etc.. But.. I’ve never felt any of that. What about us in this group makes us so different from the people that (claim to) love motherhood? Are we just more honest? Is there something deep inside us that genuinely just can’t force ourselves to like parenthood? If so, what is it? 

I want to like parenthood but I don’t. I don’t see anything appealing about never having time for yourself, always having to think about someone else’s needs, not getting sleep, etc.. 

What is in us that prevents us from being able to see parenthood as this blessing that people say it is?",Likely mother: 1 > 0
16 November 2024,Anxious every weekend,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gspkyf/anxious_every_weekend/,"I'm the one that posted a few weeks ago about not having a village. I had envisioned my kids playing outside with the neighborhood kids but sadly, that hasn't happened. My older one can entertain himself just fine but my daughter is always alone when she plays outside. I love my children but I didn't know their childhood would be so lonely. I wish we'd moved into a more kid friendly neighorhood where the neighbors actually knew each other instead of always being at home. I definitely didn't get the memo that kids no longer play outside & instead are shuttled to activities all the time.

All this to say, I like spending time with my kids. I do activities with them like board games & crafting & we go on nature walks and do things on the weekend but I feel like since I don't have a village around me that I am constantly looking for activities every weekend for us to do or she'll be bored. And I have heard it's ok for kids to be bored. Our weekends are pretty free but honestly I get irritated when she gets bored and get tired when I have to redirect her. I'm not relying on other people to entertain her, but I can't be with her 24/7 every weekend either. She's 7 years old. She's pretty shy. I won't go into detail about school but let's say making friends hasn't been easy for her.

I’m tired of being brought to the point of screaming at them, and just teaching them that this is how you act when you’re mad or frustrated. And at the same time, scaring them so much they’re crying about it.
I can’t win and wish I wasn’t their parent. They’d probably be better off with someone who is actually happy to be a parent, and that guilt eats at me every time I have to scream at them to do something or to listen to what they’re being told to do.
Being their parent just made me realize how much I’m not a parent. It just makes me feel like a terrible person at the end of the day. And puts them into some sort of trauma mode I’m sure. So more guilt to pile on.

I have nowhere else to speak about this and I have been scrutinized in other places that I have attempted to. My other Reddit account has too much personal information linked to me. 

I have absolutely zero emotion, love, nor concern for my child and I never did. I don’t want to go into detail about how I landed in this situation. I just want to say that I never wanted to be in this situation. I just want to vent. I don’t even care if I am judged or sound heartless anymore. This is just how I feel and I can’t help it. I do not care if my kid is crying, hungry, cold, or in pain. However, make no mistake. I meet my kids basic needs and I do not abuse them. But only do this as it is a legal obligation, not from any genuine love or consideration from the bottom of my heart. I have been seeking to terminate custody and visitation, and possibly farther down the line completely be absolved of all parental rights whatsoever, as I have multiple family members on my side of the family as well as family members on the other parent’s side of the family who have expressed willingness to adopt the child. When my child is with the other parent, I do not miss them at all. I feel relief. The other parent is a fit, qualified parent, and the child indeed has a village. However, that is a village I don’t ever wish to be a part of. I go through the motions of childcare, and I view the child as just…… I don’t even know how to explain it. Just somebody. If/when the other parent takes full custody, I just want to move out of state and start over. I am willing to pay any child support that I am obligated to pay. I won’t leave the kid without a guardian. That is the least I can do. I will make no attempts to reconcile in the future. The other parent is willing to let me off scot-free. This is how I’ve always felt. I have never connected with my child, even to the slightest degree, and I view the child and the other parent as people that have ruined my life. Nothing more. I cannot wait for this is to be over. I will probably be judged and criticized everywhere I go for the rest of my life, but I just don’t care anymore. I don’t. As long as I get my freedom. I will stay in therapy. Thank you all for listening. Advice or no advice is welcome. Either way, I know what I will have to do moving forward.",Unclear: 0 / 0
15 November 2024,I’m so unhappy. What should I do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1grp0ep/im_so_unhappy_what_should_i_do/,"-Summary: I am unhappy in my marriage, as a father, and am conflicted on what to do about it. 
-Disclaimer: There’s two sides to every story. This is my side and how I perceive what’s going on. She has a different opinion. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle so I’ll try to keep this factual. 


-Background: Just celebrated 8 years, both 31. Our oldest is 4 and our youngest is 14 months. Just the two kids. 
-Family history of mental health issues (BP). I do a poor job regulating my emotions and I have poor boundaries with kids and my wife.
-My mental health is poor. I get deregulated quickly when I don’t workout or keep a schedule and become a huge asshole with bad mood swings. I am in between doctors and therapists but have considered changing my meds when that stabilizes. 



-Problem: I feel like we are not on the same page for much of anything; much of what we talk about turns into an argument or I just bite my tongue to keep the peace.  My decisions are constantly questioned and analyzed and blame is always assigned to me when something goes wrong. We have a disagreement on how to handle a situation, we talk about it and express our opinions, I am lectured how I am wrong, and then we normally do what my wife wants. She thinks highly of her intelligence and it seems she feels she has to be right. Makes me feel like I’m not enough, or not doing enough; just inadequate as a husband, father, and a man. 
-She has decided on some unconventional parenting decisions I have a hard time supporting. We have discussed it many times but we do always go with what she wants. 

1. Freaks out if food isn’t organic. Very controlling and putative with this. Doesn’t care about the cost much. 
2. Sleeping arrangements / Co sleeping. We haven’t slept together in nearly 4 years. I rock the 14 month old to sleep and hold her from 7pm to 10pm EVERY NIGHT so my wife can have free hands; My wife does not approve of sleep training and letting them cry so I keep her asleep by rocking. Then I hand the baby to my wife and we go to our separate rooms. 
3. Uninterested in sex. Last time was 2 years ago when we conceived our daughter. I don’t even try anymore I’ve been turned down so much I just beat the shit out of my dick. 
4. Homeschooling. My wife doesn’t workout or clean while I’m at work. She is too tied up with the kids and somehow thinks she will get more time to herself as their teacher at home. We even had to hire a nanny just to help her around the house (she does have her hands full with my son) because she is so unproductive (around the house) during the day, I have no idea how she thinks homeschooling will work out. 



-Props to her: I will say she is a great (helicopter) mom; she cares for and pours everything into those kids. I also think she is a good wife because she hasn’t left me yet because I am an asshole a decent amount of the time, but she does still act like a massive bitch quite a lot. 
-She is a complete garbage stay at home mother though. The bulk of the home care exclusively falls on me to include cooking the majority of meals, dishes, trash, and recently grocery shopping after I get off work. I struggle with this because I feel it’s NOT MY JOB to do this crap if she is home while I’m at work or teleworking. 



-Conclusion: Looking from the outside we should be happy. Beautiful kids, new cars, enormous house, I make decent money (neither of us has any family money). I’m just so tired and fed up from being corrected what feels like every time I open my mouth. I can’t finish a sentence without my son screaming at me over some dumb shit and my wife blames his behavior on me. I’m tired of feeling disrespected by my wife, and now son who is picking up on how mom treats me. I’m tired of eating my feelings and gaining all this weight because I’m so unhappy with the choices I’ve made and where I ended up as a result. 
-I know a lot of you will probably think I’m a huge pussy, and soft and weak minded and just need to suck it up. I feel like years of what I would loosely define as emotional abuse have dulled me into an apathetic shell of the man I used to be. 
-I feel very very trapped. If we divorce, my wife is the vengeful type who would make co-parenting life HELL, but I honestly think I could show up as a better father to my children single. Divorce won’t make this pain go away, it’ll just change the type of pain. She is passive aggressive and petty and I don’t want that outcome. I also don’t want to stay in this relationship and continue to be unhappy and risk screwing up my kids. 

-I’ve contemplated leaving her for years but I am feeling more desperate now than ever. I feel like my time to make a decision is coming to an end.",Likely father: 11 > 0
14 November 2024,Daily arguments,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gr6e6x/daily_arguments/,"When I was 15, I got pregnant with my daughter.  Everyone around me commended me for “doing the right thing” and keeping the baby. I knew life would be a struggle, but I had people who assured me they would be there for me. Now I have a 9 year old. I just turned 25. The “village” is gone. I struggle financially still. Can’t seem to finish my bachelors I’ve been working on for 6 years, and my daughter is starting to argue about everything. Every night, bedtime is at the same time. Yet every night when it’s bedtime she argues that she should have a later bedtime. If I let her stay up late she cries in the morning and throws tantrums because she wants to sleep. Every night when it’s time to brush her teeth she argues. Slams doors. Closed the bathroom door and ran the water for 10 minutes pretending to brush her teeth. Screaming yelling crying. Every morning. It’s an argument. Today is picture day and I picked her out 3 options. She came in wearing a black and silver shirt with a golf and green skirt. I told her they don’t match. She argued but picked out and off white shirt. Better. Then she chose to wear knee high stitch socks with said outfit. I said “that doesn’t match, wear regular socks” she screamed and cried and told me she’s not going to school. She slammed doors and said she was going to call the police so she can go live somewhere that she can wear her stitch socks. The whole drive to school she screamed and cried and wailed. I’m so overwhelmed, overstimulated, overworked to take care of her. Why do I struggle every single day just to be the villain anyway? Just to fight over socks. The morning arguments are a regular occurrence. She wants to sleep or doesn’t want to go to school. My friends in their 20s are able to nap. Are able to go out when they want. Are able to live carefree. And I’m arguing with a kid about going to bed and getting ready for school every day. I’ve been set for years that I do not want anymore children. And my family can’t seem to understand why I’m done. Having kids is so amazing? Right? I don’t feel amazing. Ever.

I love him with all my heart but I'm so tired!! I don't have any help from my family. My mom is an old lady with depresion, memory problems (she doesn't remember any of my life when I was a child) and she is trying to help but many times she only irritates me.

And my husband is stressed because his job, never cook a meal and never takes our son to the park If I won't come too (In fact our son says frequently he doesn't love him). My husband needs I tell him all the time his tasks (like bath our son, throw the trash), I'm not feel like a wife, I feel like a mother of two. The only task he does is take our son to school because we need to take the car and I'm afraid to drive. I'm trying to lose my fear to drive but it's imposible to take time for practice.  I'm always stuck in my job, my house and my son... When I have a little free time I only can do housework or sleep. And my husband critizies me for that.
My son's teachers are always complaining about my son (we think he has ADHD) because it's imposible to him being quiet five minutes. I know, and I'm trying to help him everyday but It seems is not enough. I'm always so tired of everything. I'm doing my best (I promise) but it is too much. I want to do more but I'm not strong enough. Never have money enough. Plus I'm introvert And I'm not feel capable of talking with other moms and I feel like thrash all the time. Just want to cry in front of my computer jon and do nothing. Beside my son is my only son because of my depresion I'm not feel like to have another child. My husband is only child too and my sister doesn't want children. I'm SUPER afraid he would feel lonely (my parents ignored me for most of my life so I am) when he is an adult. Just want to cry and cry and a stop from suffering.
Please, tell me children with ADHD improve with age (I'm already taking him to therapy) I don't care is a lie. I just need to see the light at the end of the tunnel...

I used to when I was younger, but after an abusive relationship and some serious mental illness I doubt I would be a good mother.

I am overwhelmed with life as it is and I do not want to throw a child into the mix. The “partner” who got me pregnant is abusive and his family doesn’t see me as a person.

Well, my breasts have been swollen and hurting for a few weeks now. We kept joking that I’m pregnant because we hadn’t been using condoms for almost a decade and I have PCOS so it’s highly unlikely I would get pregnant.

And I hadn’t been possibly up until tonight…

My period is not a good indicator for pregnancy or not because it’s never been regular. I have been on birth control since I was in middle school to help regulate my cycle.

I miss last month because I ran out of pills and we have lots of unprotected sex

You can chastise me as much as I want. I know I was an idiot for having unprotected sex with someone who sort of loves me but is also abusive.

I’ve taken 4 tests and they all came out positive.

I’m probably a month or less along if I’m really pregnant.

I’m not happy. I’m horrified and scared and my immediate thought is that I don’t want to have a baby. I cried but not out of happiness. It’s more like grief and devastation.

It’s not that I don’t want it per se. I will love it.
But I don’t want to be pregnant and have a child to be responsible for. I can’t afford it mentally, psychologically, physically and financially.

I’ve never had a kid before nor ever been pregnant to my knowledge before.

I thought I might post here for some feedback. I serious want to abort while I’m early out to avoid as much pain as possible for all parties.

A part of me is happy I can get pregnant but this also isn’t something I necessarily want. Please help.

She had been stable for a long time but shit has hit the fan recently. Unfortunately, with her being a teen. I didn’t really see the signs until it was far too late. She’s so off the rails. Super depressed. Rapid cycling. She wants to leave our home and move in with her bio dad 3,000miles away. I am 100% sure he will take her off all of her medications and I fear she won’t live to see her 18th birthday. She’s trying to quit the sport she’s played and loved since she was 6. She’s blowing up all of her relationships with friends and teammates. Every time she starts with the “I want to live at my dad’s” I am TERRIFIED of the consequences. He doesn’t believe in mental health issues. Thinks discipline and “therapy” can fix anything, even though he has an adult child diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My kid has terrible PMDD and he won’t allow her to stay on birth control. I just cannot, in good conscience, let her live there (and I have sole legal custody so I don’t have to). But I also cannot continue to live under this dark cloud of her threats of “well then I’m moving out”. She’s refusing to go to school. Refusing to go to practice. I can’t get her to do any chores. I’m doing my best with her psychiatrist and medication changes but their policy is one med change at a time. I can’t live with myself if she leaves but I’m also so sick of her having this house under her thumb with her demands and mood shifts. She’s demanding soooooo many things in order to stay. Not all of them are unreasonable but many are. Like an iPhone with no parental controls or monitoring whatsoever. But I can’t just cave, bc what do I do the next time this comes up?

10 November 2024,Any advice for the partner of a regretful parent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gnr1ub/any_advice_for_the_partner_of_a_regretful_parent/,"I'm at my wits end here and there's a longer backstory, but I'll cut to the chase. My wife (met aged 19, married 28, first kid at 33) profoundly regrets having our two daughters aged 3.5 and 11 months. She had diagnosed PPD with our first, and through there have been improvements she still has a very difficult relationship with that child to the point I've had to confront her for being verbally abusive to our 3 year old girl. She has openly told her she doesn't love her and regrets having her for example. Her relationship with our youngest (who is more like her in appearance and temperament) is luckily a lot better.

I'm here because I've tried everything I can think of. To the best of my ability (and accepting the fact I have a job that pays 100% or our bills and takes a lot of my time and energy up,) I am an active co-parent and husband when I'm in our home. I full-time parent while my wife goes to classes or sees friends a couple of evenings a week. I take both kids out and leave my wife alone at least one afternoon per weekend. I've tried to talk about it and she tells me she feels like a failure as both a working person and mother and that she sees no purpose in life.

She's the love of my life and I'll do anything to try and fix this. So I'm asking please, if you read this, tell me it like it is. What can I possibly do to help her? Where am I fucking up? Because I'm worried that not fixing this will profoundly damage my kids. Thank you",Likely father: 3 > 2

Loosing my freedom, my identity and the ability to socialize. My baby is 9 months old and still breastfed, it limits my ability to be away from the house longer and I always have a clock ticking in my head when I’m out. We have pumped milk but daycare uses a lot of it. 
The issue isn’t really being a mom, but feeling like I’m coparenting with my partners entire family. I’m in a state with no family and currently no friends, basically my entire socialization is with my partners family. But I always feel like the outsider. Or I’m reminded constantly that I’m the newbie (we’ve only been together for 2 years) and there’s so much that’s happened in the past that I don’t know about (good and bad), even though I’ve asked and know most of it. We live with his mom and his little sister because she’s still in high school and he’s acted as a coparent for his her whole life. I love her dearly, but do have issues with how she was raised. I snapped last weekend because it was insinuated that I would raise my child similar to how they raised her (she’s given no chores, no responsibilities, no accountability when she doesn’t do something, misses 15%+ of school each year, , etc). Now his family is cold with me and won’t talk to me about it or try to make up when I’ve tried to. So now I have no socialization and I’ve just been sitting here stewing about everything that’s happened the past year. 
When I got pregnant I was in the perfect position for a promotion at work or to get a good job elsewhere. But then management became a dick, made my daily life miserable and took me out of the running for the promotion. While I was still in my first trimester my teammates also quit and I still have no one I work with in the same office. 
I had to put down my dog because he got cancer at 5 yo and I didn’t catch it sooner because of the morning sickness. 
I moved in with my partners family and lost all sense of identity 
Lost contact with all friends in my state 
Then I got pregnant again while I was 5 months post partum and had a miscarriage at 10 weeks. The pregnancy was an accident and I was terrified by it but eventually got really excited and we had already picked a likely name. I haven’t fully processed it and feel even more lonely that I just went through this and feel completely left behind by his family.

He carries blankets on his head everywhere he goes. He trades those and his shoes out every time he sees another one. So my entire day after work consists of picking up after him. My home is small so they're in the walkway if I leave them.

He left one in the kitchen. So I call him in there to pick it up. He drops the two he's wearing and grabs that one. I say, ok take it to your room and he goes to his room. I tell him put the blanket down and come get the two he dropped. He starts punching himself and banging his head on the wall.

I still make him do things, even though they cause meltdowns because 1. He needs to learn and 2. I'm so so very tired of cleaning up after him. Almost a decade of following him around the house and picking things up. I rarely get to sit down after work, until he goes to bed.

08 November 2024,i think i’m a regretful parent,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gma6zt/i_think_im_a_regretful_parent/,"throwaway account as i’m scared to post on my main.

for a little backstory, i (21f) got pregnant at 19. i was with my son’s father for 5 years, we broke up due to addiction issues on his end and he became abusive and cheated. a few years later, he was in recovery and we got back together over the summer of 2023. he left me when i was 12 weeks pregnant and has since blocked me on everything and changed his number. my son is currently 7 months old.

when i gave birth, i immediately loved him. i didn’t feel very much connection to him while i was pregnant, but i think that was more so because it was a very VERY stressful and traumatic pregnancy. the minute i saw his face i felt that i would do anything for him. i wouldn’t let anyone hold him or even give him a bottle, it was just this all-consuming feeling i’d never experienced before.

i live with my parents and my mother has always been extremely degrading and cruel (i could write for days about this but to make it short, she didn’t raise me and was an addict for 20 years). she kicked me out when i was 3 weeks postpartum and from that moment i remember being in the car crying my eyes out and telling my grandma that i think my son would be better off without me, that im not supposed to be his mom. nothing could convince me otherwise, it felt like fact. it still does which is partly why im here.

i do feel love for my son, and i would never abandon him or hurt him, but over the last 5 months or so i genuinely cannot stop thinking about how much regret i feel. i don’t feel good enough. i know the ways that im lazy, i never take him on outings, only short walks in his stroller around the block. i know that i don’t talk to him enough. there are so many moments every day where he’s just staring at me and my eyes tear up looking at him knowing i have to live like it’s groundhog day every day. he doesn’t nap EVER, there will be 7-8 hour stretches where he is fighting his sleep like his life depends on it. he sleeps through the night sometimes which i know im lucky for. every day is the exact same from the neediness, my emotions, my stress and this feeling that won’t go away. i feel so much guilt. last week was my first time ever apart from him and i feel like a piece of shit to even type this but i didn’t miss him. it feels like something bad is going to happen to me or the universe is going to punish me just for getting that out. i honestly dreaded knowing i had to come back home and be right back at square one.

what really makes me feel like shit for feeling this way is that EVERYONE tells me almost every day that my baby is easy. that he doesn’t cry unless he needs something, that he’s happy and bashful and always smiling. he is a very happy baby, but that doesn’t change the fact that this is draining. endlessly draining. there hasn’t been a day that’s gone by where i haven’t sobbed knowing that this is my reality. 

every day my mother tells me how i dont get what it takes to be a parent (which triggers a feeling in me that is so full of resentment and hurt i cant even put it into words properly). im told that my son is going to end up feeling unwanted by me by the time he’s 2, that im a bad mom. it eats away at me because it feels like that’s all true. 

it’s so hard to explain, i really do love him and i would protect him from anything, but i do not want to be a parent a majority of the time. i do what im supposed to do and i am a responsible parent, but i feel absolutely zero enjoyment 95% of the time. as i type this, my hair is matted in a bun, i haven’t showered in 6 days and my nose and eyes are raw from crying. i feel pathetic knowing so many other parents have it worse than me and im having a pity party. i just feel hopeless.",Likely mother: 7 > 1

06 November 2024,Just venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gl0plc/just_venting/,"every morning is a fight in my house . From the moment the middle one gets up at 6, every single thing is wrong. we tell him to get his pull-up off and he screams at us no. he wants something for breakfast. this morning it was a muffin, so I have him half because any time he eats he only eats half of what he's given. so he screams at me. brushing his teeth. getting him to dress appropriately for the weather. Mom leaves for work. wants to play when it's time to go. screams. no. no. no. 

meanwhile the oldest cannot be woken up. we start trying to get him out of bed at 7. I call his name, I shake him, I tap him, I wiggle his leg, I pull off the covers. nothing. I finally pull him out of bed at 7:20 and he actually doesn't go back to bed. but it takes him almost 30 minutes to get dressed. 30 minutes. by that time, he has two minutes to brush his teeth and get out to the bus. no time to eat or anything. they have breakfast at school but I know he's not going to get anything because of his stupid fucking ADHD. he hardly eats at school because he gets so distracted by the other kids he just can't fucking eat. 

then the middle kid wants to go out to the bus stop too, but he won't put on a jacket or a sweater. they just absolutely defy us. anything we tell them to do. I could scream at them at the top of my lungs and it doesn't register. sometimes they look at us and realize what we're saying but then they just fucking turn around and walk off or keep doing what we're asking them to stop. so this kid goes outside and I tell him fine, freeze your ass off. one minute later he's back inside heading to his room to grab a sweater but he won't take his shoes off when I tell him to. not at the door. not at the bottom of the steps. not at the top of the steps. down the hall to his room he goes, just fuck in ng ignoring me the whole way. then the bus goes by and he misses it and starts crying.

and these children have the fucking gall to complain that they don't ever get time to do anything fun. of course you don't have time to play or watch TV or read a book. it takes two hours to do what should take ten minutes, because you don't listen. you just don't fucking cooperate. and in turn, I don't have any time either, because I have to spend a half an hour telling someone to get their pants on. get their sock on. get the other sock on. get your shirt on. like I have to be there giving them these micro instructions in order to actually get them to do stuff. at dinner time, I have to tell them, sit in your seat. pick up your fork. use your fork to pick up food. put the food in your mouth. chew it up. 

I don't get any joy out of any part of raising children. I'm so burnt out from them being little shits that in the rare instances when they are being friendly and fun, I just don't have it in me to play with them or anything. what little time I get when they're not around or asleep that I don't have to spend working or cleaning up after them, I have to spend it recovering from them. I can't make any progress on any of my goals. 

and the money. between day care and food (most of which gets trashed) I spend probably $1200 to $1500 per week on them. I would love to have that money for myself. I make good money but I actually barely get any of it myself. After paying for them and my mortgage and bills, I get like $100 per week to do what I want with.and it also means I'm locked into my job. I make way more than I realistically should and I've never found a better paying position in my field. So now that we've built this life around these kids, who need all these resources, I can't leave for something that doesn't pay as well but would be more rewarding or offer better work life balance, that wouldn't have comparable insurance to what I have now. I can't take time off to reskill or risk it on a career change.

Altogether, it infuriates me, honestly. It all feels like such a waste. I've given up my freedom, my time, my money, my energy, my whole fucking life to have kids. For what? I honestly don't know. I don't know what the point is.",Unclear: 0 / 0

My 17 year old going on 18 in January started all of this. They do everything she does to me now. 
My 12 year old boy tell me if I hit him he will hit me back. They literally want to see me in jail. They are ungrateful and I don’t love the 3 of them. I have 3 with their rotten no good father I left when I was pregnant with the 12 year old. I also have an adult child and another son that is 9.

My daughter is a month shy of being 15. She’s dating a 16 boy who I don’t approve of. It was a culmination of things but the last incident was, I allowed him to come over and try to get to know him. He ended up giving my daughter the biggest worst hickey I’ve ever seen in my life. It was dark and all across her neck. Looked like she was hung by a rope. 

I told them it was so rude, disrespectful and they should be ashamed of themselves. I sent him home and told her he’s not allowed in my house anymore. Not to mention he only spoke a few words to me “hi, I’m ___” that’s it. 

Fast forward she’s telling me she’s gonna go to his house for the weekend. I disapproved but she’s out of control. I can’t get her to listen. There’s a lot of history here and self destructive behavior. Yes, I’ve tried a lot of things to help her. 

We got into an argument and she told me I’m a loser after I told her the path she’s on will lead to a hard life and misery. Like myself, I want better for her. She said she wants a normal perfect family. I asked her to explain, a mom and a dad (her dad is deceased but he was absentee before that). A happy family, a nice house, a mom with a good job- not what I have but a doctor or something. I have no accomplishments to be proud of. 

I worked 3 jobs and graduated college as a single mother.  I now get to work from home in a house I recently bought but that’s not a real job. And this isn’t a nice house. We went from having barely anything to plenty. 

She thinks me being a success is having a man. I explained to her, the stresses of paying bills even in nicer homes, the stresses of being married and you dont know how your friends parents marriages are behind close doors. My SIL is a doctor with a big house and married and yet she’s not necessarily happier than I am. 

I told her it’s all appearances and you don’t know anything about peoples lives. She said appearances are everything to her. That she never wants to look like me. I am 25lbs heavier than I’d like. Heavily tattooed metal head. She is the complete opposite and I call out her actions not her appearance. 

Basically I’m just hurt, I’ve done my best. I’ve gone to therapy to be a better person and mother through the years. She won’t go. I’m college educated and I make enough money to have decent things, vacation, put food on the table, etc. but she says she never wants to look like me which I think is more directed at my weight.

My twins are now 14. My son is trying to get his first job. My daughter has been on the roller coaster of life to say the least but we have finally been making progress. Academically she is doing AMAZING! She’s got all As and Bs on her report card this week and was just elected into student government. We have finally found the right set of meds for her and it’s helped tremendously with her moods. She seemed to be taking a turn for the worse over the summer and ended catching a destruction of property charge for breaking our door down. After discussions with the state attorney they agreed that she needs interventions and she is being put on probation and it seems to have shaken her out of circle of drinking the poison expecting others to die. 

I can’t say that I’m still not a former regretful parent but at least I’m not living under the constant fear of being harmed in my home. Now I can just look at it all and say ya know what this absolutely sucks but it sucks because this world is not kind to working mothers. It sucks because I have to work nights and can’t spend time with my family the way I wish I could (had to miss out on Halloween yesterday but they came home and “paid the mom tax” because I didn’t get to go.  It sucks because the weight of the responsibility sometimes makes me feel like I’m choking. 

I hate these feelings so much. When I was in the thick of the bullshit with my daughter it felt easier to justify why I hated being a mom. How many times was I hospitalized or my husband was because of my daughter’s trauma there’s a reason I hate this I have a hard kid. 

Now it just seems like the day in day out drag of needing to put others first or feeling like I don’t give enough is just drowning me. I’m in therapy and even my therapist just tells me it’s normal and sometimes the only time you can love your kids is when they are asleep.

The man overheard my little and was thankfully very good natured. He walked past and jovially said ""Ho Ho Ho"" and just kept walking on. Didn't make a real scene out of it.

By little proceeded to yell ""F*** Off Fake Santa"" the man just laughed. I tried to respond to my kid again and I had 3 complete strangers approach me to tell me how terrible of a mother I am because of my child's reaction and vocabulary.

Ya know? Obviously there are some things I needed to correct. (My kid learned the word from an older sibling who picked it up at school. And trying remove the word from their vocabulary has just made them believe the word is even funnier and want to use it more.) but despite the issues with the moment, in was actually pretty funny!

Long time lurker, but I've never coughed up the courage to post until now, because I'm really going through it.

So, for context, I am 23 years old, and have been with my wife since we were eighteen. We got married straight out of high school because she had gotten pregnant. She has endometriosis, and the ob-gyn was very frank in telling her that an abortion would have probably rendered her infertile, since she's pretty petite and it might have scarred her uterine wall which would make her womb a pretty hostile environment. Obviously, this was really upsetting for her to think about, so she opted to keep the baby, and I promised to help her with it (hence us getting married.) Our parents were also extremely supportive. We were both going to a college in our city, so it meant that they could, essentially, raise our kid for us, for which we were grateful.

However, it turned out that she was actually pregnant with triplets, which threw a full wrench into most of our plans. Obviously, our parents were still on board to help, but the pregnancy was fucking awful for her. For reference, my wife is about 5'1 and was slightly underweight prior to the pregnancy, and she only managed to gain about twenty pounds during it. She had an emergency c-section at 33 weeks, and she spent a month in the hospital while the girls were in the NICU. It turned out that they were mixed triplets, since two of the girls were identical twins and the third was fraternal (and missing a large portion of both her left leg and right arm). I absolutely fell in love with them when I first saw and held them, and I want to make that clear--I love my girls to pieces, and would die for them, all that.

But I really wish they were never born.

Between three premature babies, one of which with severely impaired mobility, as well as her severe complications from the pregnancy, my wife ended up having to defer her college offer to stay home and recover, and my mom had to go on leave from work to help her. They were very colicky babies, and we got next to no sleep. My wife went through horrific post partum depression. The youngest with the severely impaired mobility had difficulties with other areas of development, and making sure her needs were met was extremely difficult, especially since the older two were miles ahead of her. I was able to get through college, and my wife is still finishing hers (she's enrolled part time), I got a good accounting job straight out of college with a roughly 6 figure salary, and I can take care of us, but it's so, so, so much, and I grieve that my entire 20s have been consumed by them. They've started kindergarten, which has allowed us space from them, but I'm so burned out, even with all of the help from their grandparents. We have no savings and I'm barely financially stable--we only just moved out of her parents' place--and it just fucking sucks because they deserve so much better than what me and my wife can give them.

I wish I could have had them when I was older. I don't fault my wife for not having the abortion, but I still wish she'd gotten it. I wish we waited. It's fucking agony juggling three little girls, one with special needs, and a full time job, and a wife who works part time and is enrolled in school part time. I don't get a break, ever, and it's exhausting. We try to take time for ourselves, and whenever the girls have a sleepover with our parents we can have a night out and rest, but they're too few and far between and I'm just so tired.",Likely father: 7 > 0

I'm so tired of being touched and jumped on. He always wants to be held or on my lap or in my face. I'm so tired

I rarely get breaks. We can't afford daycare or babysitters very often. I do get a little family support but only on occasion. (Though I still really appreciate any and all help I get).

I know 10000% that I never want another kid. Why would I add more stress and even less free time? I already struggle when my son has normal toddler tantrums. I don't want to add sibling fighting to that. 

I want to travel and do stuff with my life again and I don't want to start over with an infant. 

Yet I feel like my family isn't complete. I feel like I'm supposed to have the 2nd child I always dreamed of. 
I fantasize what my perfect family would be like but I already know real life won't be the same as fantasy. So I'm not going to have another. 

So why can't I get over the feeling? Why do I mourn the loss of an imaginary 2nd child? 
Why does even a small part of me want to make my depression worse when I'm already barely surviving and feel like I'm only existing most of the time?

I see a lot of posts on here from parents with multiple children. I don’t understand why they had a second child if they didn’t like being parents after the first. I want to hear what changed your mind and made you want to have a second kid because I want to make sure it doesn’t happen to me in the future. 

I became a first time parent 3 months ago.
Before my baby was born, I always imagined I'd have 2 kids. Oh how naive I was. My labor was excruciating- long story but the hospital did not give me anesthesia. It felt like being burned alive. It was then while I was contemplating ways to kill myself during labor (“What floor am I on? Am I high up enough that it would kill me if I jumped out the window? Or low enough that it wouldn’t kill me and it would just make the pain worse? Do I know anyone with a gun? Can they bring it to me in the hospital? How will they get past the metal detector?”) It was then that I swore to myself I'd never put myself through that pain again.

Once the baby was born, the first night home from the hospital was the roughest night of my life. Long story short, my baby nearly died because I was brainwashed into thinking I needed to breastfeed her at all costs. While I was pregnant, I took every single class the hospital offered, and they all basically taught the message that formula was something only bad parents did, and that exclusively breastfeeding was something good parents did. Not a single one of the dozens of nurses who treated me in the hospital told me that my baby wasn't getting enough nutrition, that my milk hadn't come in, so I kept trying in vain to breastfeed her. The day I took her home, she didn't urinate the entire day- she was severely dehydrated. I tried to breastfeed her for hours and she just screamed all night. I took her to the pediatrician the next day who thank god gave the baby formula.

(By the way, not that this is super relevant but I lost a lot of blood during my delivery, so much that I needed a transfusion. Blood loss can affect milk supply.)

Then came the following week of breast agony.

Because of the first night where I tried nonstop to breastfeed my daughter for hours on end, my nipples were bloody, scabbed, chafed, cracked, and in horrendous pain. I had Silverettes, all the nipple creams, etc and it didn’t help. I remember laying in bed with my breasts out, nothing touching them, not even a bra, and sobbing from the pain.

My husband is not a bad guy at all but he was not helpful during this period. We fought a lot- he believed in the science, that breast is best, he took all the same classes as me. He kept encouraging me to push through the pain and keep breastfeeding. I was literally crying in pain with my daughter on my breast and he was telling me to keep going, even saying well he has to do painful things he doesn’t like doing like working to support the family. I insisted I needed a few days off to let my nipples recover and he shamed and guilted me about it the whole time. 

We don’t have any family support so it’s just been me and my husband taking care of the baby, primarily me since he works. I asked my husband if we can get a nanny or at least some kind of part time, temporary childcare help and he says we can’t afford it, basically blaming me, saying that the reason we can’t afford it is because we’re not a 2 income household. How do I put this? It’s not like we’re super rich but I know we can afford it. I’m currently thinking of just paying for childcare help all by myself, with my own independent savings.

I love my daughter. She is the sweetest, most beautiful little girl. But she is a bad sleeper and I haven’t gotten a good night sleep since she was born. At night she currently sleeps 3 hours, then 2 hours, then wakes up once per hour. 

I have told my husband that I will not be having another baby. That if he wants another one, he will need to divorce me and have a baby with another woman. That if I get pregnant again on accident, I will definitely have an abortion. 

I feel so certain about my decision that my daughter will be an only child, I cannot imagine ever being convinced to go through this again.

When I was a child I wanted a child. I would often get compliments about how motherly I was at a young age so of course I thought I'd love this life of motherhood but I don't. I constantly am wandering why I  didn't  realize it would be this hard. I'm only a few years in and I just miss my freedom so bad. I miss the ability to make decisions just for me. I miss not being anxious everytime I hear little footsteps and wondering what this little kid could be crying about now. The crazy thing is if I never had kids I would be angry with God about not allowing me to be the great parent I *thought* I  was destined be. The only way I could have prevented this was by being able to look onto a crystal ball and see what my life with and without kids would look like. I'm sure I would choose the life without kids. I have so long to go. Whenever someone says there's nothing more I'd love to do , I scream internally because I can think of a 100 things I'd be happier doing than raising children 24/7.

Ive noticed theres a lot of individuals with small children venting and i cant really relate to that. Im a single mother (32) of a 12 year old and while i regret the circumstances i had her under, i never really regretted having her until recently. We are having the hardest time behaviorally and im at a point that i dont know what to do, at my wits end really. I feel like ive failed her and thats whats causing her to act out. I miss the baby days so much, she was a great baby. In my mind i feel like id like another child, and im actually pregnant right now, but i keep going back and forth about aborting because i know i could not handle doing this again with a wayward child.(Also the age thing and starting over in my 30s) Dealing with her would make it a struggle to wrap my mind around/enjoy this pregnancy. I also feel like i owe it to her to give her all my focus, being that kids dont ask to be here and born into the predicaments that they are. Having another baby feels kind of selfish, especially with her having her problems. 

Advice is fine if you have some, however thats not really what im looking for. Just wanting to vent with likeminded people. I feel embarrassed to say these things to other parents, since it seems as though everyones older children are great, straight A, well behaved children.",Likely mother: 1 > 0

28 October 2024,exhausted,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gdqdt1/exhausted/,"Seems like I’m struggling more and more lately. I always wanted kids, but I was really young when I got pregnant and the guy was abusive. Honestly, I didn’t really want to have the baby but I had health issues and I was worried if I had an abortion I wouldn’t be able to have kids down the road and I’d regret it. 

I ended up a single mom, and honestly I was doing well for a while. I was able to support us, worked and finished college, & had good friends who helped out a lot. 

I ended up meeting someone else and was very much in love. We had an on/off relationship for a couple years which resulted in me finding out I was pregnant after we had broken up. We decided (with a lot of pressure from him) to have an abortion using the pill. I later found out it didn’t work when at my follow up appointment, and proceeded to have the baby. He was absent most of my pregnancy and prevented his family (who I had already met and spent time with) from reaching out as well. He was extremely hot and cold, one second promising me we’d work it out and he’d support me, my oldest child, and the baby (he has a very high paying job) and then he’d turn around and not talk to me for months. 

Now that we have the baby he’s present, we were still spending a lot of time together for a while, but he never wanted to commit and was on dating apps while I was pregnant/postpartum which ruined my self esteem.

I am so exhausted of being a single parent. I can’t get past the trauma of my second pregnancy, and I feel so burdened by these kids (and their dads). I feel stupid for being in this position, and ashamed of having 2 kids with 2 guys and not having the second relationship even work out. I’m SO overstimulated all the time and resent that even if he takes the baby, I still have my oldest (we have no contact with her dad). I dread waking up every day.

They are great kids and I'm in a happy marriage. However, they are alone a lot. When we moved to our house 7 years ago, I imagined them playing outside with the neighbors, but, and I'm not exaggerating, no one plays outside. Kids on our street walk straight from their house to the car and back. Never outside. Even when we go to the playgrounds, they are empty. When I've vented this to mom groups, I would hear ""don't take it personally. People that live in this area are busy"" I don't know what they mean by that. We are all busy. But I still find time for my kids to play. I feel like every play date has to be organized. I don't mind taking them to the playground but again it would be wonderful if they had neighborhood friends. They do have friends at school but are never invited to play dates. If I want play dates, I have to reach out. It's never reciprocal. 

Each weekend I have to plan things for them or they're bored at home. I really feel bad about having kids. Had I known their childhood would be this lonely & isolating, I wouldn't have had them.

Some of you may remember it.

I (42M) wrote that post at a very low point (in many ways probably the lowest era of my life) about my son (now 14M) and I so deeply appreciate the RP community giving me a place to vent and (mostly) receive helpful support. I understand many folks here are regretful in a more generalized or permanent way, and may not be in the place to hear a story of hope or redemption. I certainly was not there two years ago. But for those who are in a place to hear something positive (and for myself, so that my prior post is not the only record of my parenting experience in the community), read on.

It is not ""easy"" with my son (and probably never will be) but I no longer regret his existence. If he ever finds my account or my prior post (which I hope never happens), I want him to know that I regret saying so. I love you, <son's name>, and I hope you can forgive me for saying something that I did feel for a fleeting moment while I was in a very bad place because of my own limitations, but that I do not feel anymore.

We found help after our years of groping about blindly, and things are better now. We found a school that probably in a literal sense saved our lives. We got the med cocktail stabilized (for now). He hasn't set foot in a hospital since 2022. My wife (44F), my daughter (11F), and myself are all (separately) in therapy and it's helping. He has found a love of skiing, biking, and other interests. He mows the yard for me and rakes the leaves when he's home from school on breaks. He is kind to small children, and was a devoted volunteer this summer at a program teaching kindergartners how to cross the street and stop-drop-roll and the like. He has restored his relationship with his sister to the point that she views him primarily as a protector, and excitedly seeks out opportunities to be out with him in town on their own without adult supervision.

26 October 2024,It has been almost 6 months... I deeply hate myself for becoming a parent...,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1gccan8/it_has_been_almost_6_months_i_deeply_hate_myself/,"Sorry in advance for my bad English, I lost a lot of myself since them. I'll tell my whole story, because it helps me remember that I was in a worse hell, so I can go through this one...  
  
I had a decent life: in college, athletic, good spirited, decent job (pays the bills and a little extra), educated, financially stable... well, I considered myself above average. 

Then I met a girl, she was different, seemed to not be interested in my possessions or anything shallow like that, plus, she was spiritual in a manner that I admired (and I'm an atheist). We had our conflicts, but we got along very well, specially in intimacy, life was great... until she said she wanted kids.  
  
I honestly never though about kids, I started to weight pros and cons, and, rationally, there wasn't any pro (getting a 'true smile' and/or someone to love me were every 'pro' that I could think about, maybe someone to take care of my senior self, but none of this was appealing at all).   
  
She insisted that I should hear other people and reconsider. Oddly enough, my life started to crumble hard on from that moment on, like a bad omen.  
  
I got laid off (I only heard praises, so maybe my boss was afraid of me getting her place?), I had a good amount of savings, so I wasn't devastated... yet...  
  
I said my first 'no' on lending money, then I discovered that my family just used me (I always lend money to my parents and brothers, repaired and fixed A LOT of stuff, bought food for the house because of my job perks \[tons of food stamps\], almost never getting any of it back because 'we're family, we're supposed to help each other' but that's only goes one way)...  
  
Because of that, they imposed monthly rent because 'I was living there for free' (I paid like 2 months, but then I just said 'fuck you all, that's my house too')...  
  
At this moment I remember I was getting desperate (several interviews but never hired, savings running low, living with a shitty family that everyday tried to humiliate me somehow)...  
  
I was still thinking on giving us the best life, so I needed to make money fast, I was doing some hustles, but went to try stock market... By pure luck I made a lot of money on my first day (really, I just gambled and won), that really went to my head, then I had some lucky shots here and there, then I started losing more than gaining, and then just losing...  
  
I remember feeling worse and worse, feeling suicidal for so long (I don't remember very well for how long, think I repressed a lot of those painful memories), and she was with me all this time, giving support the way she could (I was raised with that 'provider' mentality, so her money was her own, and my money was ours, but she really never took advantage of it)... I was so out of myself that I remember going to cults of several religions and praying just because 'maybe it work' and doing a lot of hypocrite stuff. 

That went for at least a year (or more, I honestly don't remember), we're living like shit, enough money to survive in a toxic house, I even said, several times, that she should get someone better and live a decent life out of that misery, but she was still there hanging with me, even when I was a real piece of shit (maybe she has some mental condition, because, really, I could not take so much shit from someone).

Then I saw one opportunity on another field of knowledge, almost the very opposite of my graduation area: a tech bootcamp. It was advised that it would cost me a lot of time and sanity. Said and done.

For a whole year, I was trying to do hustles from 5 to 13, then the bootcamp from 13 to 19, then some chores before sleep (hardly got anything done)... I wasn't eating or sleeping properly, my work out was doing groceries, the content was mind breaking for me and intimacy was very rare... but I kept pushing myself on, and she was always there.

I started applying for jobs, some interviews but never hired... I was starting to lose the little hope I had left... then, after I talked with a special mentor, she just taught me how I should speak what they want to hear...   
  
And then, FINALLY, it happened, I landed on a remote job that payed above the market average! It was very tough, but I managed so well that I got promoted 5 times in 2 year...  
  
I could finally buy some quality stuffs and meals, going out dates, gym for us both, middle finger for the shitty family and a lot of other things... When I finally could provide a decent life for us, specially the woman who stayed by my side for all this time, it felt like getting out of a dense haze and finally breath some fresh air... I became even better than my old self!

Things were so good that I gave a second though on having kids. I heard her entire family, but wasn't convinced (when I asked about the good things about parenting, there was never a good answer).

But then I don't know why, I said that we should try. Maybe I felt guilty because she was with me on my very rock bottom, maybe I could not live with myself knowing that she wasted so much time of her life with so much misery, I honestly don't remember the exact reason, but I remember some feelings...

Those were the best moments of my life, we cared for each other like a TV commercial couple, and sex without protection was AMAZING, doing it inside was something out of this world. Then we discovered we're not so fertile as we though (maybe it was a sign that I should never tried).

After several attempts, nothing. Then we went to doctor, and the most unorthodox therapy actually worked, we're pregnant. Those were good moments too, I didn't have the mythic 'pregnancy lust' from her, but we're still good... until I had one dream that we're dealing with 2 boys... I woke up in the middle of the night for a long walk until the morning.  
  
I waited her wake up and asked: WHAT IF THERE IS TWO BEINGS THERE? She went from a smile to a worried face... we tried to forget and hope for the best, but we're both very worried. 

On our second or third eco, voilá, 2 very distinct parasites were growing inside her... at that moment we couldn't figure the sex, but we kinda knew it...

I started to get a little desperate, I mean we're making good money for us and a kid, but 2 kids seemed too tight, so I invested in improving myself, hoping on getting a better job.

Long story short, we had a very stressful 'adventure' on the later pregnancy (both kids were alternating on healthy/almost unhealthy), but, long story short, I felt a lot of stress dealing with things I did not have any clue about it, while working AND improving myself, and on top of that, the ""pre-delivery"" and the delivery were very, very complicated. I didn't sleep more than 4 hours in 6 days, because I had to talk to every doctor about her conditions and chase the nurses about her health, meals, meds and everything else...

THEN they came... and since that day all I feel is regret... 

Since birth, if one is sleeping, the other cries and wakes the sleeper, that starts crying too... they both had shitty stomachs (always full of gas and colic, and we followed everything by the book), they cry so much and so often... worse thing it seems that sometimes they cry just to be annoying (crying, puts bottle on mouth, still cries, spend time rocking WITHOUT ANY BURP OR FART, puts bottle again, it THEN starts to eat, oh you little motherf...) 

I have not slept well since... I have no energy, I'm now an ugly, depressive, hopeless and stupid (I really feel that downgrade hitting hard) father of two little mandrakes. They say it gets better with 4-6 months, but that's BS, THEY GET WORSE EVERY DAY.

On those first 2.5 months I endured a lot, I was doing my part and a lot of 'mothers duties', she basically only pumped the milk and changed one diaper or two. But I couldn't take anymore, the lack of sleep plus work, study and nurture were driving me insane.  
  
I started pushing more things to her, she's okay with it, plus, we got some friends that understands what we're going through, and help us A LOT, but honestly, I'm so tired of everything...

I'm tired of the house being so messy and having no energy to do anything about it...  
I'm tired of none of us having energy to do a real cooking or cleaning...  
I'm tired of those cryings that pierces my ears all the way to the center of my head...  
I'm tired of going to so many pediatricians, do all the exams and they only tell that it will improve with time...  
I'm tired of not liking what I see in the mirror...  
I'm tired for constantly being reminded on how many things I'm losing every day...  
I'm tired of not having time for myself...  
I'm tired of not remembering what is a good night of sleep...  
I'm tired of being tired...  
I'm really tired of this life...

Ever since my son was born i dont feel like myself. I feel like I'm living a lie and I'm lying to the world by pretending i like being a mom when the truth is i hate it. I hate it so much. It's the worst thing I've ever gone through. 
I never wanted kids. I got SA'd and couldn't get an abortion due to the heartbeat ban. So now I'm stuck with a kid i didn't want for the rest of my life with no help from his father. My parents help but they criticize everything i do, even when im doing well. The constantly belittle me and break me down. 
I dont know how to parent. I dont know what I'm doing. My mom says i should just know but i don't. I dont know how to play with him. As a child i never played with other kids so i dont have any experience with it.
My mom makes me play with him in the living room but there's no gate so he just runs around the kitchen, dining room, hallway, and living room. I cant keep up. I cant keep him from breaking my moms decorations she leaves out because he grabs them before i can reach him. My familys dog also plays in the living room and he doesnt leave me alone. Hes constantly jumping on me and biting me and licking me. He wont listen to me and my parents keep saying that theyll take me to his training class so i can learn but they never do.
I'm doing great in every other aspect of my life. Im doing well in school, i have a wonderful relationship I'm working on, I'm getting promoted soon. I just cant handle being a mom. On top of that my parents gaslight me constantly and treat me like I'm 14 (I'm 25). They say they want me to be independent but do everything they can to stop me. I want to leave but i have no where to go yet.

I just need people to talk to and i hope this will help me let my feelings out. But i will be straight up, I, 21f, was in a abusive relationship and now, my baby has to deal with a single mother with mental health issues. I love my baby, I love her so much and I would never change anything about her but the thing I do want to change is having a different dad. Her dad was toxic, selfish and controlling and he still is. I've been in so many things with him and I realized that he treated me so bad for so many years, we've been messing with each other for basically 6 years. I know it is really stupid but i was in love and we have good memories when we try but overall, he has a big ego, rude and abusive when he is around his friends. It breaks my heart to see my baby and realized that her parents are unstable, I didn't even want a baby with him or at all but he kept going, not listening when it comes to wearing protection,  yelled at me, screamed at me and even try to fight me to have a baby with him and I finally broke and ended up having her. I feel bad for having these feelings but I never wanted this for her. I'm scared that she will realize that she have unstable parents. I'm trying my best to do this with these feelings but it is hard. And to be clear, I am not neglecting my child, nor abusing her. I'm taking care of her the best I can and treat her the way she deserves and she is 8 months.

I don’t know why people can’t put their own bullshit aside for their children. Why can’t he just care about her development and not yell at me constantly in front of her or calls me awful names. It’s gone to the point where if my daughter see me break down she immediately gets so upset and starts breaking down to and she’s only 17 months so I just have to suck it up until I have a moment alone bc if he sees me break down he just calls me more names or weak or whatever for crying… I seek help I’m at risk of loosing her to cps… I’ve never ever believed in “kicking the bucket” no matter how bad life got but now it’s just seems like life isn’t worth living.

22 October 2024,Is parenthood harder in todays generation or is it that we’re more self aware of the role as compared to the previous generation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1g9sd4o/is_parenthood_harder_in_todays_generation_or_is/,"I’m 31F. I have two boys - 2.5 and 1 year(s). For context, I have a Masters in Engineering. Here goes,

Just go with me on this. 1900s. A time of extreme industrialization. 1950s+. Large number of women being extremely educated and entering the workforce. Fast forward to today. Women either: choose to not have children, or have kids and works and lots of daycare, or end up single parent with child half the time with them, or give up their jobs and be a SAHM.

My thoughts are: why in todays world being a mother is so hard. I can’t help but wonder. I sat in the same class with boys, studying engineering level calculus and stupid wave equations. But nothing ever prepared me saying, should you choose to give your all to motherhood, not only will it consume you physically but also mentally. You will love your children but can’t let go of the resentment that everything your parents pushed you towards - study hard, get a job, be independent (I have Indian parents, if that doesn’t explain it I don’t know what else will). You worked hard to earn that success but what your parents didn’t tell you - let go of that independence, be a mother, you’re dependent on your husband. Millennials were pushed to work hard and now if we want a family life, we’re going to have to do it without a village, because somehow, our parents now can’t be bothered to help out. But if your family income is decent, you end up choosing to be a SAHM. 

Truth is as much as we like equality in the workplace, it’s not equality in the home place. The demands of the mother are more, and I’m not blaming dads here. It is what it is.

We study hard, work hard, only to realize that we have no idea what to do when motherhood hits us this hard (translation: toddler phase). I’m 4 years into this, after my masters I got pregnant. I thought my in laws would help me (they told us again and again they would help but now they say they’re too old); while I try to get back to the path my childhood programming has forced me to do. I remember my mother (a nurse, mocking me when I told her at age 18, I would like to be a mom someday). Somehow, I thought it was ´less’ to just be a mom. It’s funny it’s women who let women down most of the time. I was so motivated and doing well at my previous job. But I wanted to have kids. So I just paused everything. 

4 years later, I feel lost, no sense of purpose, I wake up, do the exact same thing, navigate the same tantrums and I just feel like I’m in limbo. I don’t dislike or resent my children, please don’t think that way. I think social conditioning growing up in the 90s and early 2000s just messed me up. Seeing my friends who are unmarried and childless, thriving in their work and having a life outside of the house. I feel a twinge of resentment but I also know that they want the life I have. I’m grateful to be where I am in life, I’m blessed to have a good husband, so how do I fix this feelings of loss.

They say back in the day, they raised 6-7 kids easily. We also know a bunch of those children died (morbid yes, but let’s be honest here), so parenting back then wasn’t as mentally stressful to the parents of todays age. 

My question is: is my thought process wrong? Nobody is a ‘victim’ of parenthood, those are just bad days.

It’s just when all the bad days somehow roll together and become hazy, days just blurring and not knowing the start or end.

My mind is trying to make sense but mostly trying to and acceptance that societal conditioning, has made it so that some women like me feel the way we do, because we either have no village or the ‘girl boss’ attitude has made us feel miserable about parenthood.

I’d love to know your thoughts. My mind is just  overwhelmed.

22 October 2024,I was told I was “selfish” for being disappointed and sad that my close friend was pregnant..,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1g9o2zu/i_was_told_i_was_selfish_for_being_disappointed/,"For context I’m (31f) with two kids. 2.5 and 8 months. I did not hate parenthood while I had one child. But as my child became two year old, while I was pregnant, that all changed. Two year olds.. and toddlers really, are their own special kind of hell.

Recently, a friend of mine who is one of the two child free friends I have, told me that they were pregnant. I was gutted.. I wanted to tell her, “why would you do this?! Parenthood sucks!” Along with other things about how hard it is. Well, because I have a decent amount of self-awareness and compassion, I instead told a mutual friend about it.. who has 3 children, is a single mom, and I’m sure regrets her children by the way she treats them, but never says it out loud. She told me I was selfish and that is not my life or decision (the latter is completely true). The thing is… I don’t think I’m being selfish at all. I WANT her to have a full life and not be tied down with children. I WANT her to be able to do the things she wants to do.. and I know that she doesn’t fully understand what it means to be a mom. So her comment took me back.

I feel like what is really selfish is to tell people how wonderful and “rewarding” parenting is to childfree people, because you’re truly unhappy and wanting someone else to join your misery. I’m not like that at all. I don’t want the people I care about to feel like most of us do.

Anyway, just needed to rant.

I don’t want to be a mom anymore. My kid is beyond overly needy, and he’s always harassing me. He will ask for a drink for example & I’ll say to hang on just a second so I can stop what I’m doing or whatever and get him a drink. Except if I don’t respond immediately to his request or get up and do it that very second, he keeps repeating himself and starts to demand it from me.

If I feel well enough to do something like try giving my child a hug and actually give him one, he will start jumping around on me or kicking and going crazy. This kid is 6 years old, just give me a normal hug. On another note, he shrieks and screeches constantly- legitimately makes these horrible noises just because he can. No matter what route I use to go about asking/telling him to stop, he won’t stop. As a matter of fact, he mocks me or laughs about it or makes the noise directly in my face.

Now for my partner. He doesn’t help me with anything. He puts in absolutely no effort into helping me with our child when I’m getting overwhelmed (which is typically immediately upon child’s arrival home from school). He gets mad at me when I get mad at our child. He even mocks me with our kid sometimes when he thinks that the reason I’m upset/mad/overwhelmed etc with the kid is stupid. My partner was worthless during the pregnancy, he’s not an overly great dad, and doesn’t back me up with my parenting whatsoever. 

I’ve had enough. I no longer want to be here in this house, I hate it here. I don’t like my family even slightly. I want to take my dogs, the only beings that are loving towards me and just stick by my side no matter what, and run FAR far away. And never look back.",Likely mother: 1 > 0

Yes, as much as I love my daughter and as guilty as I feel for feeling/saying this, I'm a regretful parent. Like I said, I love her so much, yet I can't escape the feeling of being trapped. Whether those thoughts are realistic or not, the feeling seems inescapable.

Now I know, which I've recently discovered, I've been a victim of emotional neglect during my childhood. Emotions, except for outbursts of frustration or anger or just laughing at superficial nonsense, were non-existent in my family. Not talked about ever, at least never adressed for what they are... emotions. It seems they needed to be avoided at all time, especially fear and sadness. On the other hand, there was never any hugging, no telling 'i love you', 'how do you feel', 'I miss you' , none of it. Not even when it was obviously felt or needed. I always blamed myself for feeling the way I did and often didn't allow myself to feel anything ""negative"" at all.

Besides being overwhelmed by parenting, I also struggle to see some of these emotions trouble dealing with myself, when expressed by my daughter. I can see how that relates to my own childhood.

Lastly, I am somewhat of a perfectionist and I can't let things go easily.

Anyway, I was curious how other people here experienced their childhood, how the relationship was with your parents, or maybe see another cause for feeling the way you feel as a parent. Also, have you done anything about it, therapy, medication, moving out, etc?",Unclear: 0 / 0
21 October 2024,Guilt,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1g8nfve/guilt/,"For context Im 30 f have a 3 y/o son. The father was exposed as a child predator after my son turned 1. So he's out of the picture. My mom has been there since day one and has helped me the entire time. I already struggled with mental health before I got pregnant. At the time of getting pregnant I had already spent a few years in therapy, managing my symptoms fairly well and was in what I thought at the time a stable relationship with a ""great man"". Throughout the pregnancy I struggled with fatigue, the kind where it looked like I had narcolepsy. I got through the pregnancy thinking things would get better. They actually got worse. I developed severe ppd that lasted up until a few months ago. Through these three years I have tried to parent alongside my mom, but I find that I literally can't function. The fatigue is unrelenting. I lost my job recently due to a recent mental hospitalization. I even struggle to get in the shower and when I do, im exhausted and have to lay down. All of this even on different meds. This has caused parenting or at least engaged parenting to be possible. My mom offered to take guardianship of my son to which I agreed. I am currently living with her as I am struggling to take care of myself. I am beyond grateful to her, but I can't shake the feeling of guilt. I feel like a terrible parent and burdensome daughter. I guess I'm looking for an outlet as I am struggling with the guilt. My mom says it's fine, as she adores him and she can see that I am struggling, but I still can't help but feel horrible for putting that responsibility on her. I'm not really looking for advice but maybe someone in a similar situations perspective and how they cope.

I never wanted kids and planned on being childfree. I dont want to go into my situation but I'm a single mom who receives no support from the father (i dont want opinions or advice regarding this) and getting pregnant was the result of multiple rapes from him.
My son isnt hard to take care of- i just hate kids and toddlers are so socially demanding when I'm not a very social person. i dont know how to interact with children, even as a child myself i didnt understand how to talk to or play with other children my age. 
The main issue that keeps coming up and that i think makes my situation so frustrating is my mom. Yes, there are other reasons i hate being a mom but from experience those issues are easier to deal with when i dont have to deal with my mom too, and those issues arent what is bothering me right now (though I'm sure I'll make a post here eventually about those other rreasons)
She makes everything 100x worse. She constantly belittles my parenting, calls me a bad mom, and tells me that everyone else thinks I'm a bad mom too. If i dont do things the exact same perfect way she does then it's wrong and I get a lecture about it.
When i told her that I'm a first time mom and i dont know what I'm doing and need extra help and support she laughed at me and said that wasnt an excuse but then ripped into me when i told her i bought a parenting book to help me with skills like discipline and potty training. She said a parent doesnt need a book to know how to take care of their kid and should just know how. I never wanted children and have 0 motherly instincts so doing research and reading books helps me but apparently a real parent doesnt need those things.
Everything my son does wrong is my fault and everything he does right is hers. She gives me no credit for teaching or taking care of him and says the sole reason hes so smart is because of her. She expects him to behave perfectly, not get into anything he shouldnt (like the glass decorations she leaves out within reach), and be quiet.
She calls me neglectful and abusive because I'm not sacrificing every aspect of myself to raise my kid like she claims she does. In her eyes, everything I do is wrong. I could be the best parent ever but if I'm not doing things her way I'm still going to be a bad mom. I'm constantly being called selfish whenever i try and take a little time to take care of myself (like taking a nap during his nap, even thought she also tells me i need to sleep when sleeps).
I try to ignore her comments but its difficult because i live with her and i recieve multiple texts a day from her about what I'm doing wrong. If i dont respond to her texts immediately she yells at me but also gets mad because I'm on my phone too much. I've tried asking her for advice and she refuses, only giving me advice in situations i don't ask or want it. When i ask for help she will just tell me what I'm doing wrong but wont explain how to do it right. Ive tried telling her that what she is doing is discouraging and hurting me and she told me my feelings dont matter.
My son and i will play in our room most of the day. I dont like playing in the living room because my family has a dog that does not leave me alone when I'm out there. He jumps on me, bites me, and doesnt listen to my commands. My mom hounds on me for staying in our room all day but when i do come out and we play in the living or playroom we are yelled at for being too loud or for me scolding the dog for jumping and biting.
Everything i do is wrong and it doesnt matter how hard i try i will never be a good mom. I hate being told i need to sacrifice every part of me to be a mom and being called selfish when i dont. Every day i wish i could find the strength to just get up and leave. It takes a toll on me emotionally, my depression and suicidal thoughts have never been so bad and I have suicidal thoughts every day.
Ive tried  talking to my mom about my depression and Ive explained that it only makes it harder for me to parent. She says depression isnt an excuse, every parent has depression, every parent doesnt want to be a parent, and that i need to save my sob story for my therapist.
I feel like things would be better if i had the space to raise my son the way i want. I'm working on getting out of my familys house soon, hopefully by the end of the year (yes i got a lecture about how bad an idea and selfish this was as well).

I can do really well for a while, keep my shit together, take them places, have fun with them and laugh.  To the rest of the world I look like a decent parent.  My therapist says I am a good parent because I care about how I treat them and I try really hard.  But I am basically doing it alone, so I am constantly stressed out.

And then I lose my shit.  I get really angry and then I get mean.  *downright fucking nasty*

And I often can't control it.  It's like the anger takes over and I'm no longer able to think about what I say.  I just feel hot and mean and hurt and awful.

This month has been balls to the wall busy and i am stretched super thin.  My 9 year old had *another* meltdown today that lasted way longer than necessary.  I managed calmly for as long as i could.  And then i snapped and got mean. , my 13 year old asked me to please stop being so unnecessarily mean.  And I lost my shit further and told my kids I was doing the best I could but can't pretend anymore just for them.  I dropped the bomb that I'm divorcing their father.  I gave them the news that I was blowing their world apart while I was angry and screamy.  I don't expect they will ever forgive me and they shouldn't. 
 
I honestly wish a fucking bus would hit me and make their lives easier.  I've been in therapy for more than half my life.  I've been on all sorts of meds and nothing ever seems to work.  I'm just fucking broken and shouldn't be in charge of raising anyone.

We have had so many tests done on him. He started seeing a pediatric GI doctor for chronic diarrhea that has been happening for 2 months now. All the tests are coming back normal with his poop. But his GI doctor ran blood work and told me he's anemic and to give him a multivitamin. 

I feel like a failure despite doing everything I can for this kid. My son is extremely picky when it comes to food. We cook a variety of meals, and he just won't eat at all. The only thing he eats are crackers and cookies. Yes, I do feed him that because at least it's something. When I have denied him the cookies and crackers, he will have nonstop temper tantrums and still refuse to eat normal food.

So of course he's now anemic. The boy doesn't eat. I'm doing everything the doctors are telling me. But I can't control a 2 year old. I can't get him to eat or do anything. I have even taken parenting classes through my local university, and not even their tips work with him. He's just special like that. 

And please, no advice on getting him evaluated for autism. I know he is autistic. But I've been dismissed by 2 different pediatricians. They won't hear me out. I don't want any further advice on that topic because I know what to do. But I can't make a doctor help me. 

I'm worried my son will end up hospitalized. He's pooping with chronic diarrhea every day 4-6 times a day. And on top of that he's anemic. I feel like I've been dealt the short end of the stick when it came to the child lottery.

Now I want to hurt myself. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1g7h6e2/i_accidentally_hurt_my_kid_now_i_want_to_hurt/,"I always had wanted to become a parent… then I had kids and have felt from day 1 like I’d bitten off more than I could chew. 

I have a 6 yr old autistic (verbal) and ADHD son and 4 yr old daughter who has hearing loss, speech issues, and suspected ADHD. So they’re not typical kids at all. On top of that, I am a single mom. My ex-husband never wanted to be a parent to begin with so he’s left me high and dry. He pays child support but sees them only enough so they don’t forget who he is, but he plays nominal to no role in their upbringing. So 1) I’m out numbered by the kids 2) I’m handling them alone constantly with no break except when I go to work 3) they’re special needs 4) I am diagnosed bipolar 2 so I feel like this is just a recipe for hardship and disaster. 

My son in particular just— is HARD. He doesn’t listen to me, he’s always sensory seeking, he doesn’t sleep much, he throws constant fits, and he tries to rule and control everything. He tries my patience and triggers me on a daily basis. Almost every single day, I have to walk away from him at some point and collect myself because it just feels unreal and like a cruel joke to have to deal with his antics alone. 

Last night, everything boiled over and something bad happened. I got pushed over the edge and I hurt him and now I can’t live with myself. We had a cousin visiting and bringing her 5 yr old daughter over. I told my kids that cousins would be visiting. Both got very excited. My son expressed his excitement by snatching up my water bottle, pouring it in the floor, then running through it and sliding. I tried making him clean it up to no avail, so I had to do it. My kids played with my cousin’s kid and they left after about 45 minutes. My son was super overstimulated and asked to take a shower. Our hallway bathroom just contains a shower (not a full bath tub), toilet, and sink. While in the shower, he pulled the towel inside and stuffed the drain. It caused the water to overflow into the floor and the entire small bathroom floor was covered. Then he started jumping up and down and the water was splattering into the hallway. At that point, I pulled the towel off the drain, let the water drain, and ended the shower. As I was drying him off and preparing him for bed, he refused to cooperate with everything— didn’t want his eczema lotion on, kept pulling his private out of his pull-up and laughing, and kept running from me when I would try to put his PJs on him. I finally got him and my daughter ready for bed and decided to try to clean up the soaking wet bathroom before I put them to bed. 

Here’s where everything gets crazy. I was in the hallway bathroom cleaning up. That bathroom is directly across the hallway from my daughter’s room. Both of my kids were in my daughter’s room. I could hear jumping on the bed. I told them to stop jumping and pick out a book and that I would be in there to read to them once I got the bathroom dried. Next thing I know, I’m walking out of the bathroom with wet towels and my son approaches me laughing with curtain rods and curtains in his hands. He had torn down the curtains in my daughter’s room. It was like a pressure cooker. I snapped. I’m not sure what I said but I remember bending down and screaming in his face, taking the curtains and rods from him, and pushing him out of the way to walk into my daughter’s room. When I pushed him, he fell onto the floor. There was blood everywhere. He his tooth had cut his top lip. A day later, it’s still bruised and swollen with a small cut underneath. 

At that point, I couldn’t get my thoughts together so it took me a while to figure out how to use my phone to call my mom. My parents don’t live far from me. I think I just told her that something bad happened and to please help. She arrived rather quickly and helped finish cleaning up the bathroom, put the curtains back up in my daughter’s room, then offered to let my son spend the night with her. I thought that was best so I agreed. 

I have been crying off and on since last night. I have not thought of an unaliving plan for myself but I keep having ideation about wanting to be unalive because of losing it on my son. 

I truly do not feel equipped to be their mom and no one will take them from me. My ex husband won’t take custody. I’ve asked him to split 50/50 and he won’t even do that. I have asked my parents to temporarily take them so I can gain coping skills and work on my mental health. My mom just tells me “parenting is hard, things happen, all will be fine.” I told my best friend I don’t think I can do this anymore and she told me just to “go into another world mentally.” 

My son came back from my mom’s this morning and I have been very triggered by his behavior multiple times. I took both kids to an open play event at an occupational therapy gym and then to a grocery store with me and my son did nothing but throw fits, try to dominate other kids, and disrespect me. 

If I had known that having kids would not only result in daily rage and frustration, but also accidental violence from me, I would’ve never had them. I seriously don’t want to be alive right now.",Likely mother: 4 > 1

I have taught them how to dress, shower, clean up, and cook. I am not perfect with any of those. Sometimes, I am just too tired to take care of it all every day. I try to get them to help, but a lot of times they just ignore me. Well, at least 2 of them. One is diligent, but like me gets fed up when he feels like he has to do everything.

It was a skin color difference issue and the people were sticking it to us. I heard this, so I am not making up stories.  (It was bad enough that I moved out of the country.

I got upset not because she peed, not because she covered her ears, I got upset because in a rare moment of happiness she has to ruin it. 

This isn't the first time either she deliberately crushes happiness. Singing is a sign of happiness? I used to sing the few time we've tried now it's either ""STOP"" or ""shut up"" or ""DONT SING THAT"". By the time I have broken it down kind enough that, hey you're being rude this is a communal space and we're allowed to sing - the will to try is gone. She will tell other adults in the family to ""Stop laughing"" or sit their growling at them.

The will to be happy has been crushed after years and years of this shit. It's demoralising and I'm afraid I will never be able to be actually happy in her presence if she doesn't start to absorb her actions and anger can and do really hurt people.

She'd never do that at school tho, she knows that if she did that to her friends they wouldn't want to be around her. She knows if I did that to her she'd get rightfully angry and call me mean and rude.

His dad is condescending, judgmental, rude, and inconsiderate and I’m so over it. I’ve tried talking to my fiancé about it several times over several years and his response has been essentially ‘he’s my dad, you can leave if you’re uncomfortable’. I hate that I’m stuck with these people for the rest of my life all because I didn’t get an abortion. I’d be so gone so fast if my daughter didn’t live here. I also feel so stupid for not having my own money to be able to leave. To be able to provide my daughter with her own room in my apartment, like she has here, in her dad and grandfather’s apartment (I say his apartment bc he’s also on the lease and it’s more theirs than mine considering nothing I say matters when he’s here). I don’t know what to do because no matter what- I will be the bad guy. I refuse to cause a scene because my daughter genuinely already favors her dad over me. She has flat out said it. “I love him more” “I’m on his side”, “he’s smarter”, little things here and there. I get it, I don’t blame her. My mother suffered from mental issues her whole life and I heavily favored my father because of this too. But just like my mom, I feel it’s a combination of both mental health issues and lack of respect/consideration from the men we made the mistake of having kids with, that drives us damn near insane. 

This was probably all over the place because I was typing as I cried, hiding in the room, wishing I’d cease to exist. Mostly just needed to get shit off my chest because I don’t have any friends and I’ve probably annoyed my mom and sister with my endless venting every time I see them.

16 October 2024,Theory: We hate it because we're good people.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1g56m0c/theory_we_hate_it_because_were_good_people/,"Ok stay with me here.

People who enjoy the drudgery that is parenting do not consider the outcome of their parenting. Like, it's easy to go through, say,  a neuroscience degree program if you don't give a shit about your grades and getting the degree. You just sit in the classes logging time till they're over. You fail. But you did go through the motions of getting the education. That is how a LOT of people parent.

If you don't give a shit whether your children's deepest needs are met, if you don't give a thought to whether they develop good character and experience a positive childhood, then of course parenting seems ""easy."" You give them food, water, shelter and clothing, and then let them blow their brains out with screen time till adulthood. Boom. Done. You've parented.

On the other hand, everything I read here is from people who are overhlwhelmed by the relentlessness of creating a well-adjusted human. Whether that is helping your child navigate the world with a disability, or simply modelling and instilling good character so they have a happy life and contribute positively to the world...these are the aspirations of good smart people who recognize the magnitude of the job at hand. 

We all have different problems, upbringings, and emotions relating to the godawful slog that is parenting, but we wouldn't be here complaining about it if we didn't care. And that's something a lot of kids don't get from their parents.",Unclear: 0 / 0
16 October 2024,PMDD/AuDHD makes it worse ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1g55d5m/pmddaudhd_makes_it_worse/,"Just ranting. 

I can count on my hands how many days a year I get without kids. I’ve always suffered severe anxiety, depression, both sides of disordered eating, body dysmorphia, insomnia, PCOS, etc. It wasn’t until my 6 year old got diagnosed that I was found to have AuDHD and PMDD. I didn’t realize, even after seeing 5 therapists in a decade and being used as a Guinea pig for SNRI’s and other mood stabilizers, that I’d lived a life of avoidant behavior to handle my AuDHD. Now, after kids, the result is unavoidable. 

I’m trying to give myself grace for trying to learn how to handle mental issues that weren’t caught by the crap doctors I have around here while also trying to not traumatize my kids. I think many days I handle the constant over or understimulation but then I have days like today that I I crash. Maybe I’m not effectively coping or using enough regulation techniques because my meltdown and spiral into raging anger and depression just bursts through the dam. And I do and say things I can’t take back. 

I put the idea of kids and having a family on a pedestal since I lost my mom at 10 and dad used a bottle for his grief, I said one day I’d have that back. And in doing so, I didn’t create realistic expectations and couldn’t account for the added mental health problems. Today, is one of those days that I’ve held it in too long and I wish I didn’t have kids. I actually wish I could just cease to exist completely. 

Someone once said “I love my kids, I hate being a mom.” 

It is not my kids’ fault. They didn’t ask to be brought into existence. But my god I wish I could suffer a bout of amnesia, run away to a cottage in the mountains, and never deal with humans again. Maybe it would help if my basic needs and my wants could be met more but that’s not how this year has gone. 

I’m grateful for this thread so I can say this somewhere people might realize I break my back and spirit to do better for my kids, but it’s fucking hard and sucks and I’d love to stop faking and masking to cover it up. It’s exhausting to pretend I’m ok.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

16 October 2024,I can't be everything to everyone ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1g4po96/i_cant_be_everything_to_everyone/,"I've posted here a few times. I'm mostly venting but if someone has words of wisdom please comment. 

My husband became a SAHD in July and we've settled into the new routine. I've found ways to get out of the house during the day to focus on work when I can't handle working from home and hearing them throughout the house. He doesn't historically have the best time management skills and isn't the most decisive person either. I had a hard boundary of no gatekeeping when he took over certain responsibilities that we both discussed and agreed upon as part of his SAHD role. I'm trying really hard to stick to this. 
My 1.5 yr old is a Velcro child to me (mom). I literally have to sneak around the house so he doesn't see me if they're home and I want to go to the bathroom or get food from the kitchen. As soon as my 8hrs of work are done I'm on baby duty. 

So I'm the emotional support parent to my child until he falls asleep. He is glued to me for 3-4 hrs after work. He immediately starts crying full in tears if he can't see me. I know it's a phase and as he gets older it'll get easier, but it is still distressing to hear him crying when I'm just trying to grab a glass of water in the other room. I have a technically difficult job so I'm mentally exhausted and having to manage a clingy toddler to give my husband a break. As soon as bedtime is done and I come downstairs, husband wants to spend time with me and needs adult/intellectual interaction.

Tonight I had something important to work on after baby went to sleep. I even blocked it off on our shared calendar and is a time sensitive thing and I communicated this to him. And yet, he still spent HOURS tonight talking to me about all sorts of shit and asking like deep questions, and of course if I try to politely cut him off and focus on my work he gets huffy, or it turns into an argument. This isn't the first time this has happened and he has kept me from getting things done in the past and staying up way too late because he wants to have a discussion about something. It's usually stuff that would normally require my input, but even when I've said I don't have any input or am ok with him making the decision without me he asks me to have an opinion (otherwise it turns into an argument) and I ultimately end up having to make the decisions anyway. 

It's particularly annoying when he feels like he didn't have a say in something because we didn't have an hour long discussion about it even if we came to a conclusion in the first 5 minutes. It doesn't matter if we agreed early on or it was clear I had to make the decision and I made it so I could move on to what I wanted to do with my time that he's eating into. He''s on the autism spectrum so he has to get his thoughts out to let something feel completed from his mental list. 
I'm getting so frustrated with this happening so often. It's like he loses all sense of time and the most important thing is that conversation. He also can't focus on more than one thing at a time and gets annoyed if I'm trying to multitask. I understand that he hasn't had any real conversations for 8hrs that day, but I am so worn ragged most nights to turn my brain back on for him.",Likely mother: 3 > 0

Yet a few days ago, a woman on the same sub made a post asking if she was an asshole for only wanting weekend custody of her daughter because she's disabled (the mom is disabled, not the kid), and the comments were saying how horrible of a parent she is. 

So men get a free pass to abandon their children because their wife cheated on them, but when women are physically incapable of being a full-time single mom they're horrible? 

It isn't even just those posts, women in general have to suffer the consequences of parenthood way more than men. Some women are emotionally and physically abused by the father of their kids, yet if they abandon their kids, even if it's literally save their own life and be free of post-separation abuse, they're ostracized. I have a friend who was beaten so badly by her sons father, she lost teeth, needed stitches and I had to testify in court as a witness for her, and she still has to have that abusive POS in her life because they have a son together. 

But a man just gets cheated on (sorry redditors, it isn't the worst crime ever), and now he can be free of all parenting responsibilities and almost nobody judges him!!

My wife wanted children, but I wasn't sure I ever did. Once we had them, and ended up with twins 8 years ago, she basically flipped and is as uninvolved as possible. I work mostly from home, and on top of it, we lost our only reliable babysitter so I have to try to wrangle them along with my job. They spend way more time on youtube and video games than I think they should, but otherwise I literally wouldn't get any work done or would have an impossible toy mess to clean up. They won't even go outside without me. My wife sleeps in until after the kids are up and have gotten everything they need from me, then works evenings so when I'm done with work+childcare I don't really get a break, then I get to do dinner and dishes and cleaning after the kids and baths and getting ready for school and story time and bedtime and daddy I can't sleep daddy I need water daddy daddy daddy. I don't care about ""traditional gender roles"" unlike the pieces of shit I once called dad, but I don't want to do EVERYTHING.

I love my family and would never do any harm to them, but I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I have expressed my frustration to my wife several times and it has gotten a little bit better, but I still do the bulk of everything. When I get crabby and my wife tries to be the calm and reasonable one, I try to explain why I'm so frustrated and she just throws her hands up as if to say ""what am I supposed to do?"" Maybe your fair fucking share?? And on top of it our sex life has all but completely evaporated, except for some frustrating teasing. Our relationship is great outside of sex and childcare, but I feel like I'm falling out of love on top of losing any motivation to be a dad anymore.

I don't have my own dad to turn to for help or guidance. My biological dad went to prison when I was a tween after years of abuse and recently died in prison, and my former stepdad drunkenly torched my mom's house during a fight and disappeared after a (surprisingly short) prison stint, which is fine because I wouldn't have anything to say to him except ""go get hit by a train"". I don't think I would ever do something as extreme as either of them, but I'm afraid of snapping and leaving my family some way and continuing the cycle. I am a yelling, angry dad and feel like I have almost no backup. I want to stop dreading every day. I want to stop saying that I hate my life and being a dad.

I'm in Florida, and in an area that was predicted to get directly hit by Milton. We evacuated the state, and  drove for 12 hours with a very whiny and overtired 2 year old who wouldn't go to sleep. 

The screaming, the whining, the temper tantrums all drove us insane. My husband was driving on 23 hours without sleep, and I thought he was going to lose his cool and pull over and just walk away. I tried everything I could to get my son to shut up. Snacks, phone use, tablet use, toys... the damn boy just.would.not.stop.crying. For 12 hours straight. 

It got to the point that we both let him cry and ignored him. There was literally nothing else to do. And we tried to stop as much as possible but there was no gas and the lines to get into rest stops were ridiculously long. My son screamed to the point that he lost his voice. That boy is something special, and I don't mean that in a good way.

And now we're in the Airbnb, and we extended our stay for another 2 days because supplies are non-existent in my city, and there's no power and gas. This boy is making our lives nothing short of miserable. He won't nap. He won't eat anything but cookies. He refuses to sleep at his normal bedtime. The temper tantrums have increased. I'm just done. 

I told my husband this emergency trip to another state wouldn't be so stressful if we didn't have our son. And amazingly, he agreed. He is not a regretful parent like I am. I'm surprised he's starting to understand why I hate my life so much.

I'm trying to keep our son busy by taking him out to play grounds and museums. But nothing matters. The non-stop energy and temper tantrums only get worse. Plus, I have to constantly keep my eye on him so that he doesn't destroy anything in the Airbnb. I haven't been able to relax since we evacuated. All of this just teaches me how much of a mistake I made by having my son. He is literally making our lives a hell hole. There's no beating around the bush anymore.

Now I have the long drive back home to dread because he'll just cry the entire time. Great. FML.

 I know it’s a recent common name to serve morning sickness. They are finally doing more studies and actually taking some action of taking parent serious with this medical condition. So far the long term effects are brutal and discouraging. 

I’m just wondering did your child(/ren) had any developmental issues or diagnose with anything? Also what was the long term effects on your body and mental health? 

I was just having random thoughts of my kids and how much hell it was to make sure they survived with little to nothing while pregnant because I couldn’t even keep bile inside. Always in the hospital and struggling alone. Out of all my pregnancies 2 survived and it did cause a lot of health issues for both me and the kids.",Unclear: 0 / 0

It got worse after I had my second child 6 months ago. The age gap between my two kids is 8 years and since she's been born, I have been living my days questioning myself as to WHY THE HELL I decided to revert back to the baby stage after being out of it for so long. Also- having two kids feels like a million kids when you spent 8 years of your life adjusting and getting used to only having one child. 

I have love for my kids, but I don't enjoy being a mother and I'm not someone who wants to be around a bunch of kids all the time. I've experience a ton of depression and anxiety over my life and I think at one point I thought having a child (or two) would fix it, but now I just spend my days reminiscing on when things were easier and when I had more freedom and less heaviness on my shoulders. 

I'm sure some of these thoughts are attributed to having an infant right now and maybe (hopefully!) as she gets older, things will improve and I'll find my peace again, but all I feel right now is a whole bunch of regret, denial, and sadness with the feeling that I'm constantly on a leash being pulled around and feeling stuck, inflexible, etc. 

I felt like I had gained a lot of my freedom and time back before we had our 2nd baby. My oldest is 8 and having just him around was so easy compared to the complexity we just added with a new baby.

09 October 2024,I have multiple panic attacks every day and I hate my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fzt8hj/i_have_multiple_panic_attacks_every_day_and_i/,I had a broken home growing up and a crazy mother who tossed me out at 11 years old. I am beginning not to blame her for doing so. All I ever wanted was a big family and I thought I wanted like 6 kids. I wanted to create the family I never had. I was misguided and got pregnant at 16 and gave birth at 17. My sons father hid from me that he had bipolar disorder and other mental health issues. He went to prison like 6 months into the pregnancy and was never involved. My son was just awful. A precious baby but a terrible toddler and young child. He lit things on fire constantly eloped was just a terrible child. I did not let that deter me and thought there wasn't anything I couldn't handle if I just gave him enough love and attention. I went on to have three more kids the youngest of which is 1. My son was diagnosed with adhd and odd. But I thought we were managing. I found out that he had inappropriate contact with my 7 year old daughter. When he was 10 and he was 6. He grabbed her butt and told her to get naked and get in bed with one of her stuffed animals. She told me and I called emergency mental health services who called cps. Cps determined that I was a protective parent and that everything was fine and that apparently this is not something unusual but happens often as kids begin being curious about the other genders body parts. He was not molested and both of my children insist that this only happened once. It has been months now but I am now terrified of him and do not see him the same anymore. AlsoI do not feel like I am cut out emotionally to be what my daughter needs me to be. I have to have constant eyes on every single one of them when they are in my home or I have a panic attack. My daughter goes with her dad every weekend and my sons go with my younger sons dad as he formed a fatherly relationship with my oldest as well. I feel so much relief when they are all gone and feel panicked and cry almost every time it is time for them to come back. My son is now almost 12 I have him in behavioral health therapy and I'm getting him evaluated by a psychiatrist because I think he may be bipolar and developmentally delayed. If I could go back I would never have had any children at all. I am not strong enough for this. I am so suicidal I made a will and got a life insurance policy that will allow for self eliminating within 2 years of the policy being active. I ruined my life. All I ever wanted was to be a good mom and have a happy family. It turned out God put me all alone in the world because I was supposed to be. I keep telling myself don't be selfish in 6 years I can be done with my oldest and almost done with the rest. I keep telling myself it'll get easier and that it'll only hurt my already hurt children more if I die but I constantly am hoping for an accident or terminal illness.,Likely mother: 6 > 0

08 October 2024,I asked about relinquishing my rights. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fysl9f/i_asked_about_relinquishing_my_rights/,"Backstory in my post history, but the TLDR version is my wife (44/F) and I (38/F) adopted our daughter (17/F) out of the system at 14. We were lied to by the foster care agency, and are now trying to parent a child with extreme mental health issues. We are very literally afraid she’s going to kill us. 

(Please respect that I don’t want advice on anything involving her diagnoses or case plan. We already have numerous professionals involved, and I have a degree in the mental health field.) 
_

Our worst fears are just continuing to come through. My daughter decided that she was going to escalate to physical aggression with my wife. She has developed an obsession with guns. We found the word “murder” in her search history, and we can see that she was trying to hack into our security system. 

We requested another screen for a long term hospital stay, and the worker recommended against it to the insurance company. She said again that we haven’t exhausted all resources to keep her in the home. We have three other workers involving their supervisors to help us file a grievance. One is also going to talk to the director. But it doesn’t matter… not if she hurts us before anything happens. 

I notified the school that she’s unstable and escalating. I don’t think she would hurt anybody but us, but I also don’t want to be that parent who knew her kid was dangerous and never told anybody. Just like I don’t want to be on Dateline because I was brutally murdered, I don’t want to be on CNN because I failed to let the school know what was going on. 

My daughter is now also trying to weaponize the mental health system and the the help she is receiving. She has been trying to get us in trouble with professionals for years, and she finally found somebody stupid enough to believe her lies. I’m now dealing with emotional abuse allegations. I’m not worried about anything actually happening to us because of the report… it’s well-documented that every allegation she’s making is something in her case plan, recommended by her doctor, or is a consequence of her own actions. (i.e. restrictions are put on her cell phone so she can’t text the friends she wants to get high with. Yes… she really said that.) 

So I did it. I asked the social worker if relinquishment is an option. I don’t have the answers yet. I don’t know is we can, and I’m not sure 100% sure I have it in me. But I still found the guts to ask.

I’m breaking. I have never regretted something so much in my entire life. I would give anything to rewind time back to three years ago so I would have chosen a different kid. We could have adopted a kid who wanted to have a loving family instead of one who is actively trying to destroy that family. 

If I didn’t love my wife, I would have ran for the hills long ago. I wish that all I had to do was pay child support. But I can’t do that to my wife.

08 October 2024,I don’t think I want anymore kids.,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fyoa94/i_dont_think_i_want_anymore_kids/,"I’ll start this off by saying I was the dumb teenage girl who didn’t know anything about safe sex or birth control. I gotten pregnant at 17 and I was 18 when I had my son, who is now 8 years old. I was still a child myself, his dad and I were broken up before I found out I was pregnant and we did try to make it work but we both weren’t right for each other so we decided on being co-parents. Then when our son turn 6 months, he told me he enlisted in the military, to provide for our son the only way he knew how to. 
So off he went. And I was SO angry at him for essentially abandoning his son and I had to raise him all on my own, I mean the financial help was great to have but I was there through it all, by myself. Which at the end of the day, created a stronger relationship between my son and I. 
Because of this ordeal, I had my doubts of having future children. I didn’t want to raise two kids alone, let alone three or whatever. But of course I didn’t write the idea of having another kid down the line completely off but this time I was more educated on safe sex and how to prevent pregnancy and other things. Then two years ago, I met my now partner, and things have been so amazing. He really is the love of my life. We never really had the children talk when I ended up pregnant, on birth control pills. I knew in my heart that I couldn’t ever have an abortion, and he didn’t want that either but I was scared as hell that he was going to abandon me the way my sons father did. I think I sort of detached myself from my pregnancy, it was a hard pregnancy for sure. I had gestational diabetes, cholestasis, high blood pressure and I went into preterm labour at 32/34 weeks which resulted in weeks of hospital stay until I was 36 weeks. I didn’t breastfeed because honestly I just needed my body back. My daughter is now 4 months old, her dad is the best father and admittedly he handles the grunt of the labour, we’ve even discussed me returning back to work instead of him as we’re both on MAT and Paternal leave. I love my daughter so much, my son as well. I just don’t think I can put my body and mental health through another pregnancy. I am on the IUD so hoping that this method works. I just never really admitted to it before. I’ve talked about it with my partner when I was still pregnant and in the hospital, I did ask him if he would be okay if she was our only daughter and our son was our only son. To which he said of course and if it’s something we really agreed on, he’d make an appointment to get a vasectomy. Then he told me to wait for a year after our baby, to see if I still feel the same way as I did. Which it’s been four months and I honestly still do.",Likely mother: 6 > 0
08 October 2024,I hate being a parent,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fypanr/i_hate_being_a_parent/,"My son is 5 years old and has aggressive tantrums multiple times a day. Occasionally he resorts to violence toward me or my spouse (biting, kicking, hair pulling, scratching, etc.). My spouse and I are burnt out, depressed, and hopeless. We currently go to couples therapy and each go to individual therapy. We tried taking my son to a play therapist but he refused to talk to them at all. No one has any helpful solutions, and it’s beyond depressing. Today we tried being fun parents and went to a local Halloween event. We immediately went to the food trucks to order dinner. I took my son to find a bench to sit on. Our son had a can of soda and accidentally spilled some of it. He was very upset and wanted a new soda. I tried to empathize about the soda spilling and how that’s frustrating, then tried to point out he  still had a lot of soda left (like 3/4 a can). He screams no at me and proceeds to dump the whole can of soda out, then demanding I buy him another one right now. I said no, I won’t buy you another soda, you made the choice to dump it out. He yells at me some more, throws the can of soda at me. Keeps demanding for more. I tell him no and try to send a text to my husband who was waiting for our food still. My son freaks out and tries to grab my phone, begging me to not tell dad. Then goes back to complaining about how he’s thirsty and doesn’t have a drink and wants more soda. I point out he dumped his soda out, so I’m not buying him more. He starts hitting me and using his costume mask to attack me. My spouse comes over with food and tries to calm him down and reason with him. Nothing is working, so we tell him we need to go. He starts clawing and biting my husband, who has to carry him to our car that was parked a ways away. Our son is screaming horrible things like he hates us and we’re stupid. My husband and I are both gentle, shy people so this whole ordeal was an absolute nightmare. We’re both crying on the drive home and send our child to his room for the remainder of the evening.

07 October 2024,Terrible 2s and one one the way ,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fy7mr7/terrible_2s_and_one_one_the_way/,"Hi parents! So I’m a 31f mom married with a almost 2.5y and another on the way. I believe my toddler has hit what we call the terrible 2s. I wanna emphasize I do not regret her but I need to vent cause god damn this is so hard! I’ve been a SAHM ever since we had her and from about 11m- 1.5y I had help at home but sadly I had to back to back experiences w Nannie’s so I let them go and was in my own until she hit 2. We now have her at a little school where she absolutely loves. But when she’s home she’s just so needy always needing attention throws temper tantrums if she doesn’t get her way. She only goes to school part time for 3 hours. So those 3 hours I try to pack in as much as I can. I workout pick up around the house and have lunch waiting for her. Now that she’s in school she sick ALL the time which has created more anxiety for me bc just before she started school she had roseola which triggered a febrile seizure so ever since then she sleeps in our room w us ( before then she always slept in her room) so that’s just another added stress to the mix anytime she sick I worry another seizure will trigger. I’ve always been a fun vivacious woman but now as a mom I suffer from so much anxiety and depression. My anxiety has gotten better but my depression is not. Obviously I still get up and do what I have to do in regards to care for my daughter and family.  But on the days where she’s being extra hard ( and to be quite frankly hard she has more bad days than good) I cry bc I feel like I can’t anymore. Some days I want to runaway I’ve thought about booking a trip and just disappearing for a few days but my husband not my daughter deserve that and plus I know she needs her mommy. I can’t lie and say I haven’t thought about ending my life. Anytime I have a bad day I think of it and even if thought of ways of how I would do it. I just know deep in my heart I would never do that bc I never imagine leaving my beautiful daughter w/o a mommy and I know the pain it would cause my family. I used to do therapy and was on Zoloft 25mg but I stopped seeing my therapist the minute I felt judge after a session. I quit cold turkey Zoloft when I found out I was pregnant bc I looked to deep into possible effects it has on the fetus. 

I am officially halfway through my pregnancy and I have no idea how I’m gonna juggle 2 of them. I knew I wasn’t ready for another but seeing my friends and family have their 2nd kids even some that have kids younger than mine made me feel pressured. Of course there’s the family and society pressure of the constant oh when’s the 2nd one coming blah blah. So I fell for the trap. My husband and I purposely tried and after 5months we conceived our now soon to be son who is due in Feb. but u knew deep down mentally I wasn’t ready. Now I have no other options but tho go through it and deal with the consequences. Part of me is happy to give our daughter a sibling and welcome a new family member but it’s not like the first one bc now I know the mental and physical load that comes with a child. 


We do have family support and my mom is the one to help out. She will take my daughter to sleep over her house every so often so my husband  and I can catch a break or do a date night which I’m grateful for but still sometimes doesn’t feel like a long enough break. My mom also will come spend many nights at our house and help around with house work and ofc w my toddler. She really is a huge help but I still struggle mentally. My husband and I are both drained and we know it. We don’t regret her for one sec but we are both so in love w her but it doesn’t remove the fact that this shit is so damn hard. Car rides are hard as she hates her car seat and most of time screams only once in awhile we can get to calm down w music she likes and can sing along. Eating out is absolutely not ideal as she kind of goes crazy doesn’t like sitting will throw fits at times. Unless we are eating with more family members in a group then she may behave. When she throws tantrums in public I hate that people stare and I get so nervous and anxious that Everyone is looking. I see well behaved toddlers at dinners ect and wonder why mines most of time won’t sit with us well behaved while out eating. At school they tell us she’s well behaved and loves it so at least I know she’s well behaved elsewhere. I am aware that she’s misbehaved with us bc we are her parents, her safe zone ect. 


My husband is very helpful and is honestly a great dad and husband. He is able to provide a life I never thought I would have. We are financially stable and comfortable can take family trips comfortably and we have a decent house in an affluent neighborhood. He helps out a lot to be honest. He will cook when I don’t feel like it he’ll pick up around the house, help w her ect ( as any father should ). But we are both very stress it’s obviously causes a lot of fights and arguments between him and I. Luckily we are able to get past it and not hold grudges quickly but still it has taken a toll on our marriage. I can’t lie and say I don’t grief our life before kids. 

I know many of you will ask if I get anytime for myself and the truth is I do when I can but it’s hard. My husband doesn’t work a typical 9-5 so he has a lot of flexibility and is around to help a lot but still he has work calls appts ect. So when I do need to do something I need to make sure it’s around his schedule ( like getting my nails done ect) on weekends we try to do things as a family. I live in south FL so it’s been unbearably hot but now that the weather is getting nicer we can get out more. All my other friends have their own lives w kids and stuff too so it’s hard getting together and when we do it’s usually w our kids. I know when we do get a break from our daughter we miss her dearly and can’t imagine life w/o her. But again I just never thought/knew how hard this would be. Is their just more challenging toddlers than others? I pray to god this boy is a tad more easier.  And pray it gets better w age. We do plan to transition my daughter to school full time in Jan. So it will be just the baby and I home for the hours. Some days I cry especially if I don’t get good sleep bc then I’m unproductive. I won’t do house work and just dread my feet the whole day. But the days I do get good sleep Im productive and get myself out of the rut.

I feel the most uneasy sense of dread. Just depressed. I'm not excited to see them. I don't miss them. Just sitting here in an empty, quiet, peaceful house with nothing but my own thoughts. Desperately trying to enjoy the last hour of freedom.

While I am grateful that we have someone to watch the kids, I hate the glimpse I get of how life could have been if I never had kids. It's such a tease.

I was so happy yesterday when we went out for brunch. It's like I am myself again without the kids around.

06 October 2024,Life literally sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fxbk3r/life_literally_sucks/,"I have always wanted to be a mum. I love my daughter very much and I would die for her. It just hurts to think that no one listens to me. Hence, I’m here. I have graduated with 2 diplomas and invested so much in my education and now I’m a STHM and that’s okay. Because I love taking care of my daughter even though it’s stressful. I just can’t help but wonder what if. 

I have talked to my partner about this multiple times and I don’t think he hears me. His mum lives a minute drive to us and told us when I was still pregnant that she will be here every weekend. Which I find too much. So I asked my partner if we can still have a few weekends just to ourselves. He says okay but still argues with me that his mum is there to help and I’m not letting her. And that she had raised 3 children and they were all fine. I have always expressed that this is my baby and I want to do it my way. I don’t want her watching my baby because last time I saw her kissing my baby even after telling everyone “No KISSES” and she shook my baby twice playfully on different occasions and she puked both times and I have told her not to shake her cause she just fed and she did it anyway. Now, I have told this to my partner and he said “she stopped doing that. Why are you still holding that against her”. I’m just so tired of arguing with him every weekend cause guess what. We see his mum every weekend with her very strong perfume and her sticky toys. He always say it’s just for an hour but it’s not. I have to make sure baby is fed, changed and awake. Cause she’s just 7 months old her wake window is not too big. And I have to feed her and bathe her when we get back from his mum’s place. It is an hour over to his mum’s but it feels like I’m doing more than and hours work. And watching her mum with my baby is giving me so much stress. She was trying to let my baby walk by pulling her arm up. It makes me want to pull all my skin out. This is seriously making me crazy. 

I just feel like I have given up so much to be treated this way. My big ass is flat like pancakes from breast feeding. My boobs are in different sizes. I cook for him, do all the housework. Is it asking for too much to have time with just my family??? Am I overreacting?",Likely father: 6 > 1

I was going to start looking into tubals when I found out about him. My partner has always wanted kids. Good for him. 
I have never been financially stable. 
I have never been mentally stable. 
I had just lost 30Ibs. 
I was told I needed to ""connect with the baby because they can feel your negative emotions."" I spent my whole pregnancy getting told to ""suck it up."" And ""what's done is done."" Even my therapist was like ""this is your reality. You gotta start living in it."" 
 Anti depressants made it worse prior to pregnancy. 
His father left town for a year. Only coming back for the birth. Now he is just over 6 months. His father returned home. 
I had to live in this guy's house, and take care of our dogs, while being pregnant. I had no support. 
Now that he is back Im having a harder time being a mom. I have to minimize my emotions and my self. I feel like I'm cutting myself to fit into a puzzle where I don't belong. 
He is a great kid. When I look at him all I see are my dreams crushed.  
I just want to scream. Cry. Be alone. 
This has been the worst experience of my life. I wish I could just die and have it over with already. 
I never feel safe stating this stuff out loud. 

Edit; I want to address a lot of stuff in the comments. Firstly; Thank you all for the support. 

When I wrote this yesterday, I was in one of my bad spots. It doesn't take away from the honesty I put into the post, however I was typing in a rush with an overwhelm of emotions. Much like I will kind of be doing now. 

I want to clarify; I believe in the right to your own body. I'd never get an abortion myself. I do believe every woman has the right to choose. It's never an easy decision. I also had my tubes tied when he was born. 

We were using protection. Myself, and several women I knew who'd gotten pregnant around the time had their protection fail.

I LOVE my son. I hate my overwhelm. I hate my life. I hate me. I love my son. I couldn't leave him. It hurts to even think about. 
His dad is an amazing father.  He is stepping up as best he can with his few weeks of experience. He is trying to take to the role as best he can. It's harder trying to mesh him into an already established routine. 

Also, his dad and I have been together for well more than 5 years. 

I am breastfeeding. I'm actually combo feeding. I never produced enough, and it's been the hardest part of this journey for me, and one of the biggest sore spots of my depression.  It's important to me to do both to try and establish that deeper bond that I don't feel, and haven't felt. 

I lost my job. As soon as I get one, I will be prioritizing my savings. I do have an emergency exit plan. It's not something I'm oblivious to needing. 

I am seeing a new therapist. My insurance changed and I had to get a new one. They are still new, but I can only see them once a week. I'm trying to do something about that to increase my visits, as clearly I need more.

What I didn't realize is how much energy two boys can have. And it's the kind of energy that a quiet, reserved person like me doesn't understand. It's constant jumping, running, throwing, and shouting. I can't walk down the street without apologizing to someone because my boys are crashing into passerbys. No matter how much I've talked or scolded my boys, it never stops. It drives me INSANE. 

So, I find myself sometimes regretting having boys. I see little girls sitting quietly, reading, drawing or chatting with their moms and I'm envious of that calmness.

Hey guys. I just had a baby almost two months ago and it’s been… a difficult ride. I am in my 20s and before getting pregnant, never wanted kids. I always established in every serious relationship that i never wanted kids and my now husband, when he was just my boyfriend, said that my choice was my choice and he never would pressure me. But when we got pregnant 6 months into dating, he as well as my family talked me into keeping the baby. I cried and cried over the fact that I was pregnant because I knew that in this world, husbands and fathers rarely ever match the work a mother does when a couple has kids. I was so scared to be a single married mom who was unhappy in her marriage and life. I was scared I was going to lose my beautiful body I had taken so long to build in the gym. I was worried to lose my career and lose the skills I’ve worked hard to get. But whatever, my husband said we would do it together. 

So I kept the baby. And we had a beautiful baby boy who I love dearly. But then second night pp and trying to recover from a long labor and delivery my husband just would not wake up unless I threw something at him. I could barely get his help and night and during the day I couldn’t sleep because I was in pain. Since my son has been delivered there has been an unequal load of work during the day and at night and I am completely miserable. My career is at a standstill and I’ve forgotten a lot of how to do my job since I was just getting good. My beautiful body is gone and filled with stretch marks. I’m hideous. I’m living my nightmare and I can’t help but resent the people that talked me into not getting an abortion.

But whose gonna do the housework? Take care of the baby? Make appointments ? Clean? Now I just have to suck it up and learn to accept this new life.

I (31f) coparent with my son (4m)’s dad (29m). the custody split was so miserable. he kept our son from me for months while it was ongoing and i was desperate for it to end so i went with it all just to properly share our son again. I’m so over and exhausted from the custody drama to ever go back into a mediation or battle again. We settled on a joint 50/50 but my work schedule doesn’t allow me to be off entirely on weekends so we try to accommodate each other when it’s convenient for him. If not, then I lose time.

Besides that, our son is too young to understand our need of separation and constantly begs for us to be together so he doesn’t have to divide his time. I try for the sake of our son, but if ever his dad disagrees with my parenting then he takes his side and then they both gang up on me and now my son stops respecting my authority. 

Tonight my son asked me for food late. I got him exactly what he asked for but then he didn’t eat any of it. I told him he had to eat it but his dad stepped in and decided to take him home and disregard the whole issue. I said if he is going to take him from me because of this then just keep him.

He doesn’t respect me or consider me like a coparent, but more like a glorified babysitter. Of course I am the mother, but none of the decisions are made with my input. My schedule is manipulated because he coordinates childcare day by day. I can’t plan my life around it because I’m on call instead of having accommodations made days or a week in advance.

I just feel so defeated all the time. My whole life seems taken over by people who don’t even respect or appreciate me. My son prefers his dad anyways so I really don’t think my absence would matter.

Honestly rather than accepting this reality I would just take my life. The scrutiny and expense of starting over is too much to handle. I’m sure it seems completely selfish to abandon parenthood. But after creating and carrying someone in your belly for 9 months just to have someone else dictate your relationship and allow when you can and can’t be with them, and take away when they disagree… I’m just feeling like they’re better off without me anyway.",Likely mother: 5 > 3
30 September 2024,Looking for the exit,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fshow1/looking_for_the_exit/,"I’m the parent of a 6 ½ year-old severely autistic child (cognitive delays, nonverbal).  It was clear early on that my son had developmental issues; however, my wife and I were in denial and ultimately didn’t get a formal diagnosis until he was almost 3.

 
Since then, life has been difficult, whether it be feeding (only eats 3-4 things in any given week), getting him to sleep, keeping him engaged etc.  Nothing is conventional, there is no logic or pattern to any of it.  He doesn’t do normal play or understand games, it’s purely sensory (watch dirt/sand fall through his hands).  Otherwise, he will watch the same set of youtube videos over and over.  We can’t go to restaurants, movies or do most things normal families do.

 
Due to these barriers, it leads to conflict and tantrums, which is especially difficult due to the communication/comprehension issues.  He has this shriek that he uses when he doesn’t get his way that literally hurts my soul, making me want to rip my ears off.
 

To add to this, there is the financial strain as the waitlist for special needs government funding is 5-6 years where I’m located, which is super awesome given the importance of early intervention. 

 

I’m just tired…. I never wanted a child, but because I’m a coward/afraid of conflict, I went along with it.  I’m always jealous of other families, because they have conventional lives.  I’m also always embarrassed by my son’s behaviors (loud stimming) and how it in turn reflects on me (even though I recognize it mostly imagined).  I’ve started reading up on the horror stories of parents managing severely developmental teenagers, so I get to look forward to cleaning cum off the walls and stopping my son from touching himself in public. 
 
To add to my fears, I just saw a video that basically confirmed what my future will be.  

https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/housing-support-for-adult-children-with-severe-autism-is-absolutely-absurd-say-parents-1.7046744

The article/video shows a father in his 60s, desperate to get his son into a group home, but of course the wait is decades long.   This just confirms that  I will be managing my son until the day I’m too weak or ultimately drop dead (the government would provide supports to visit the house etc.).
 

I feel angry, trapped and have no hope for the future.  I think about suicide often, although I don’t think I could ultimately go through with it.

 
I’ve started therapy, which I enjoy because it allows me to vent to someone, however, I don’t think I have the personal strength to reframe this situation into a positive.  I also recognize that despite these challenges, my life is likely 99% better than most people, however, I remember how much things were better before we had a child and wish for a return to normalcy.  I also judge my self worth based on the lifestyle of friends, family, coworkers, and stress how I am not in lockstep with everyone else.

 
Anyway, I’ve started to consider the idea of giving 100% ownership of the house to my wife (it’s nearly paid off).  I would live in an apartment and provide weekly support.  I’ve also thought of trying to find a job in super remote areas (e.g. Yukon, Nunavut,),  where they would potentially provide housing accommodation and then I could just send money for my wife to hire some kind of support worker.

 
I’m not really expecting much of a response, but it helps to get this on the screen.  Thanks.",Likely father: 3 > 0

While at daycare he's structured, naps, happy, at home he hardly takes a break, and nights especially he seems to get a third or fourth or fifth wind and will play roll jump nonstop and fight any signs of tiredness. dad me loces roughousing and playing a lot and mom is also high energy, generally we feel like we have a high functioner on our hands, but days like today after running on the beach, yard work, social time w new people, good meals and nonstop stimulation he's still off the walls at bedtime (started routine before 7 with a bath and reading + milk). 

We're not overly concerned, but at the same time don't have anyone in our friend / family circle to relate to -- ""my kid goes to bed at 8 and we have to wake her up at 8"" or ""yeah they're a great napper"" haha yeah right not us. FWIW the infant is a sleep legend and much easier to put down than this guy ever was.

29 September 2024,Hurricane Helene and my cranky 2-year-old,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1frv5x0/hurricane_helene_and_my_cranky_2yearold/,"I'm in Florida, and because of Hurricane Helene my power was out for 1.5 days. Went out late Thursday night and didn't come back on until around 5 a.m. Saturday morning. We spent the entire day on Friday driving around our city trying to find places to stay. We ended up having to spend the night at my parents because they live 5 min away and did have power. My mom is recovering from major surgery, so I really didn't want to bother her with my toddler, but my parents took us in anyway.

In the meantime, my 2-year-old son has been sick with chronic diarrhea so he hasn't been going to daycare at all last week, forcing me to work while taking care of him at the same time. I can't get anything done at my job when my son is around. And I have a job where I have daily productivity goals to meet. I have taken my son to the doctor twice now and the best they can do is offer a stool sample test. 

So as you can imagine, I had already been having a rough week with my kid, and then the hurricane comes making his daycare shut down so either way even if he hadn't been sick I still would have to keep him at home. I ended up having to take Friday off unpaid since my son was sick, and we had lost power. I legit don't have any more time off available at my job.

The entire time we were dealing with not having power and trying to find places to stay, my 2 year old wouldn't stop whining and throwing temper tantrums. Like I know that he doesn't know what's going on, but damn, dealing with external stressors that you have no control over is made much worse when you throw a small child into the mix. He was whining in the car (we spent a lot of time driving), then once we got to a destination he'd whine because his toys weren't there or because he didn't have cookies. There was always something he'd fuss about. Plus, I was checking his diaper as much as I could because I worried he'd have a massive blowout due to his diarrhea. Things got to a point where I wanted to smack him to teach him to be quiet especially given the circumstances we were in, but I never went that far. I really don't want to hit my kid. 

It was a hellish week between dealing with my son's chronic diarrhea and a hurricane plus my son's non-stop whining and crying. I can't tell you how much I thought about how easier this situation would be if my toddler wasn't around. I could work in peace and not risk losing my job, plus dealing with an emergency like not having power for days would go a lot more smoothly if he wasn't a factor. My toddler was literally ruining everything, and I grew very resentful of him. 

I really wish I could go back in time and undo all the steps I took to have this kid. I have so many regrets in my life. But having a child is the biggest regret I'll always have. He's a constant source of stress, and I'll be real honest here, he does not make me happy. I don't find him cute or the things he does adorable. All of that is overshadowed by the terrible things he does like unnecessarily giving me a hard time about everything (he even fights me when I try to change his diaper). I just don't see what ""joy"" parenting brings because it hasn't brought me anything but grief and lots and lots of stress that I didn't have before he was born.

Stupid me for thinking I could handle a child. He doesn't even listen to me when I ask him not to do something. He's so defiant. And I hate everything about him right now. I feel so dumb for having a child and thinking I could manage it. I feel silly for giving in and listening to everyone who said having a kid was ""worth it."" I should have stuck to the fence and not have had a kid (I was on the fence about having a kid for many years). That fence was my friend and was what was keeping me from making a huge, irreversible mistake. Now I see my hesitation about being a mom was correct. I'm not built for this shit.

There are good moments… and even when moments are good I sometimes wish I could go back and off myself before ever having children. It is always this same thought when I fall into moments of regretfulness. I wish I loved being a mom and having kids. I feel like something is wrong with me. I often feel miserable even though I have so much more than most people. My husband works so hard to help me and try and make my life easy which is part of why I’ve never told him. I think he would feel terrible. I have two children- my oldest goes to daycare full time and my second goes part time. When they are at home, we have a nanny part time and I have not worked since being pregnant. Whenever I am alone with them it usually feels like so much work. I feel sick keeping this to myself, but don’t want to risk hurting g my husband. I think about dying all the time.

I'm tired of going out and being judged when my 5y/o severely ADHD  boy throws a tantrum and throws himself on the ground screaming bloody murder because he can't have everything he wants it's embarrassing and I get so many glances from random people I do get the occasional person asking if they can help but I just tell them he's a bit upset or when he demands to push the trolley around and almost bumps into everything and everyone. I'm sick of the anxiety when he's at school, wondering when and if I'm going to get another call to pick him up because he was too distracting, would try to run off school grounds or would attack a student or teacher. or at pick up time he'll ""ragdoll"" and scream and cry when me or his dad attempt to put him in his car seat but he refuses to get in himself which mind you is quite difficult because he's 40kg due to a medication his paediatrician put him on a couple yrs ago. I'm sick of him trying to run on roads and refusing holding my hand when crossing. I'm sick of him being fussy and never wanting to eat vegetables and demands to get takeaway and when we don't give in he screams, hits and threatens to run away. I'm sick of him hitting his (4 y/o) sister when shes simply singing or doing nothing and complains she's being annoying when shes not doing anything to him or sometimes he'll rip up her art. I wish I never showed him how to play the PS5 cos that's all he likes to do in saying that he is ridiculously good at playing Roblox and I enjoy playing it with him but when I take it away so we can play outside or with toys he loses his temper and threatens to break the tv or this or that. There's so much more but I think most of that just about sums him up

I'm tired of taking my 4 y/o out and her running off and nearly losing her, I'm sick of buying her toys only for them to get destroyed days later or never be played with again. I'm sick of her jumping all over the couch when it's already almost broken, I'm sick of her jumping all over me when I'm clearly holding the little one, I'm sick of her randomly screaming at the top of her lungs because she thinks it's funny. I'm tired of constantly having to remind her to go toilet a million times a day or she wets herself or if she does she'll hide and change clothes and try and make it look like it didn't happen even tho I've explained millions of times it's an accident and she doesn't need to hide it but to tell me or dad so we can clean any mess but to next time go toilet as soon as she needs to no matter what she's doing in that moment I'm also sick of when we do go out her saying she needs to go toilet se we take her but she was just pretending which makes hard to believe her when she says she needs to. I'm sick of her wasting hand soap and shampoo to ""make a potion"" or ""make slime"". I'm sick of making meals just for her to ""not be hungry"" she'd rather eat cereal or noodles. I'm tired of getting her pencils or crayons because shes very artsy and will draw on the walls when I'm not looking. I'm sick of her taking her socks and shoes off as soon as we get in the car especially when it's cold whether and she knows we have to get out the car. There's more but this post is already getting quite long. 

And lastly I'm sick of how clingy my 18 month old is, seriously I can't put her down to do anything without screaming or crying and when I pick her up she wants to get down. Just the sound of her crying makes me want to shove knives in my ears, she's very non verbal so she still cries for everything she wants (I'm very sensitive to loud noises but other sounds like crying, chewing and multiple people talking at once and barking is something that drives me up the wall).
I'm sick of having to share a bed with her because she doesn't like sleeping I her cot or at least fall asleep in it. I'm annoyed that she wont go without her dummy, everytime I try and take it away and habe her not use it she screams and cries and I'm tired that no matter how much I encourage her to say words she doesn't.

It's so tiring, I always knew being a parent would be hard especially because I have bpd and can barely handle my own emotions but I always wanted kids so I could show them the love I never had. But I've been regretting them more and more each day especially lately. By the end of the day the house ends up a mess and I hate leaving the house anymore because I just feel so embarrassed or my anxiety gets so bad. Usually at the end of each day I'm crying because I just don't know what to do anymore, I go to bed hoping the next day will be better or hope this is just a bad dream but always wake up to it being the same shit different day. All I try and do is show them love and try to teach them wrong from right but I get nowhere. I still love them despite the regret and stress, I would never want them to feel like I don't.

25 September 2024,I regret taking over guardianship of a child,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1fp82tv/i_regret_taking_over_guardianship_of_a_child/,"So I am the guardian of a 16 almost 17 year old I am a relative in my 20’s and I was given custody of him after his mom passed away and there was no one else who would take him in. Said kid is a nice kid but his mother was a drug addict with a lot of mental health issues who never passed 10th grade and never made him do anything. When he came to live with me he didn’t know how to cook, clean, or do laundry and after about two months would get absolutely pissed if asked too do anything he is okay now he does it all without me having to say anything. He has been living with me since he was 14 so 2+ years now. I was not prepared to be a parent but everyone in the family knew this kid would be down a parent at some point in his life and I stepped up. I’m having a major problem with getting him motivated and socialized. Before his mom died he missed 100+ days of school because she didn’t make him go and would stay in his room 24/7 gaming. Even thought it’s been two years and he’s opened up more he usually picks one person to put all his emotional baggage on and that it he doesn’t care about it anything else but that person and video games. My main issue is I cannot get this kid to turn in and do his schoolwork he’s not having trouble with it he just won’t do it or turn it in. Just like everything else I have to keep telling him everything to do all the time and I’m trying to get him to understand he’s already been held back a grade and is going to be a legal adult in one year I cannot keep logging into his school and telling him every time he needs to do an assignment if I don’t he just won’t do them and will let his grade drop too and f. He doesn’t care about anything but his gf and video games. if you take his video games or phone  he threatens to harm or kill himself publicly in his own words he does this for attention and because he’s upset because he has no way to cope (can’t talk to gf or online friends). I’m at a loss no matter what I do he won’t take the initiative to do anything. I’ve had him in therapy for months already he won’t open up and/or talk to a therapist. He talks to me but again superficial. Won’t join clubs or make friends at school either  and the more you push the more he pulls away. I love this kid to death but his mom left me with a lot of bs to deal with and I’m kinda getting to my wits end he’s gonna be a legal adult in a year and is incapable of doing stuff without having to be told. He shows no appreciation for anything still have to remind him to have basic manners. Acts like it’s privilege to talk to him. I know this is normal teenage stuff but I really could just be traveling right now. This kids mom burned a lot of bridges for years and before she died to the point there is no one else who wants him. I’m sitting here trying my hardest to do everything to make him happy and it just amounts to nothing. He made a comment about running away with one of his internet friends across the country when he turns 18 when he first came to live with me and sometimes I find myself daydreaming about the day to see if he will actually do it I will miss and love him but at this point I wouldn’t stop him. I’m just trying to at least get him to get a highschool diploma for the military but he wants to do nothing. Parents how do y’all deal with this as a childless person with a child lol?? Im over it but im not giving up I don’t have a choice he doesnt realize it I don’t think but neither does he if not me he’s going to foster care.",Likely father: 4 > 1
25 September 2024,So much crushing guilt about having my child,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1foudlj/so_much_crushing_guilt_about_having_my_child/,"Unlike many of you, it seems, my kid is actually pretty easy, which feels like it means I'm an even worse parent, because I've struggled so much, and still do, even on easy mode! 
She is nine, and beautiful, crazy smart, independent, loves animals, and is mostly respectful. She games with my boyfriend, and siblings, online, and needs little from me, but having her around is still such a trigger for me. 
I regret bringing her here to suffer like me.  
The biggest guilt is that I knew I was a barely/not functional adult, with multiple mental, and physical illnesses, who was in an abusive relationship, and I had the baby anyway! 
I had literally had him kick me out, while still bleeding from an abortion with complications, maybe 6 months before. At the time I felt like I couldn't go through another, but it was still my dumb ass that went back, as soon as he wanted me, and got pregnant! 
I didn't know my issues were genetic, and I didn't know he would work so hard to push me out, and replace me. I didn't know she would look just like me, and that would trigger the shit out of my childhood trauma! 
She's been mostly raised by my ex, who has been emotionally abusive to her, just like he was with me, but I have not been in a place to get her back for majority time, because, *shocker* becoming a parent actually DIDN'T turn me into less of a mess! 
I've also been suicidal for like literally my whole life, and people also suggested that having a child, would give me something to live for. Now I have a child, and a dog, and a boyfriend, and a bestie, and I still want to die everyday, but now I feel guilty for thinking about leaving them!  I've just been in SO MUCH PAIN, the since about her age. 
And yes, I've tried basically every therapy available. 
Now my daughter is in pain. She tells me she's full of rage, and frustration with her dad, and the mean kids at school. She's developing early, and being sexually harassed, and i know how thw world will treat her. She's starting to injure her joints over and over, struggle with running, get tired, and overwhelmed easily, all symptoms of my hypermobility disorder. I know part of the reason she is so easy is because she is shutting down, and turning it all inward, just like me. 
Her dad has custody, and won't allow treatment. He believes I am a hypochondriac, trying to pull her into my delusions, despite positive tests, and official diagnosis, and her clear symptoms, she wouldn't know to fake. 
I feel like the biggest piece of shit, because I'm not trying to fight for custody right now, but I'm barely holding my head above water, with lots of support, and I struggle with the time we have, and my own life admin stuff, so taking on all that feels impossible. So she's stuck. 
Then there is the fucking state of the world, and of women's rights in the US. 
I really think to myself ""buy the fucking VR, and merch, and cookies, let them enjoy the end of civilization"" 
She loves being with me, which  again, makes me feel like an asshole for not being able to just take full responsibility for her (though the lawyer isn't sure we would have enough anyway)
And yes, I am seeing multiple mental health professionals, and several doctors. I take my meds, and my supplements, and go on my stupid walks, and drink the water, and even had magnetic stimulation to my brain (TMS), and I'm still depressed AF, with severe CPTSD from basically every kind of abuse.
She deserves better than I can give her. People say I'm a good mom, because I'm good at interacting with kids, for brief periods, but I get overwhelmed after a couple hours, and desperately want to rest, alone, and then not only get snappy, but struggle with urges to hit them, and intrusive thoughts.
